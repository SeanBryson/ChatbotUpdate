1516,f00ae3c3929d829cd469ba4f229cc613b0766203,"Comedian Jenny Eclair travelled with her other half on a Painting In Venus break with Flavours . There comes a time in a woman’s life when beach holidays just don’t cut it any longer, when lying on golden sands (unless you’re buried up to your neck) serves only to remind you how much weight you forgot to lose again this year and how ill-fitting your swimming costume is. Being control freaks, most fifty-something females find ‘doing nothing’ a bit boring – after all, there are only so many hours one can spend on a Kindle, and woman cannot live by fiction alone. This is the time when the ‘alternative holiday experience’ tickles your holiday tastebuds and you find yourself looking at brochures for Nordic cruises. Excellent! Everyone looks fat pointing at a fjord while wearing an Aran jumper. But apart from choosing chilly destinations such as the Arctic or Scarborough, your other non-lolling-about option is the ‘activity holiday’, which can range from Pilates to kayaking, or painting to pottery. Yes, I’ve crossed over: the world is divided into those who still want to ‘give it large’ in Ibiza, and those who want to find their ‘inner artist’. An excursion to Venice one day provided inspiration for the budding artists . I’m in the latter camp – and I’ve got the paintings to prove it. Over the past year, I have found enormous pleasure, not in shoe shops, but in the haberdashery department of Peter Jones, or any shop that supplies art materials. I’ve developed a yearning to be creative. I wanted to do something in my spare time that saved my sanity, lowered my blood pressure (without going to the gym), soothed my soul and, with any luck, provided some cheap Christmas presents. Cooking has never been my thing, I’m an enthusiastic but rubbish knitter, but I did do A-level Art, so I decided I fancied being taught how to master watercolours while simultaneously having a holiday somewhere nice. Bingo! Last autumn I found myself spending a week in Treviso, just outside Venice, with a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks. Now before I go any further, I have to warn any single ladies that if you’re looking for hanky-panky, the Italian painting/cooking holiday combo may not provide rich pickings. With the exception of the painting tutor, Scotsman Hugh, and my other half Geof, we were middle-aged women to the core. Fabulous, hilarious, slightly eccentric middle- aged, middle-class women with plenty of pashminas and photos of dogs on our iPhones! Jenny stayed at the Villa Bianchi, a comfortable farmhouse surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both Treviso and Venice . For seven days, we painters were patiently guided by Hugh through the basics of sketching, paint technique, colour and form, while the cooks stayed in the kitchen making our meals. I know who picked the short straw. But then, as they say, it’s horses for courses. The cooks wanted to chop vegetables into smithereens, while we artists wanted to sit in a medieval market town with a paintbrush in one hand and a glass of prosecco in the other. Of course, it wasn’t all work. Two days into the break, our holiday operator Flavours herded us all into minibuses and took us to Venice. Like schoolchildren with credit cards, we roamed the most beautiful city in the world and came home, inspired by its mind-boggling loveliness, with lots of photos to copy into our art books back at our base, Villa Bianchi. Staying in Treviso, just outside Venice, Jenny stayed in a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks . Although it was in the middle of nowhere, the farmhouse was comfortable, surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both Treviso and Venice. The grounds were meticulously kept and the garden featured a very attractive landscaped pool. Being the only couple, Geof and I had a separate annexe to ourselves. It might have looked a bit garage-like from the outside, but inside it was large and comfortable and contained a small kitchen (handy if the cooks in the main house aren’t up to scratch). Accommodation in the main villa was simple but stylish, whistle-clean, and with lots of bold splashes of colour and squishy sofas. Outside, a covered colonnaded area meant we could paint outdoors even when the weather turned. In terms of relaxation, the holiday ticked all the right boxes – Geof and I had a completely stress-free break, and other people did the cooking. How marvellous is that? There was no need to feel anxious about restaurant bills as the food and drink were entirely inclusive, even when went out on day trips to Venice and Treviso. As for our artistic endeavours, Geof cheated, having been at art school in the 1960s. Heavenly backdrop: Church of Santa Maria Della Salute at dusk, Venice, just one of the Venetian sights that provided inspiration in the historic city . He quickly became the teacher’s pet, which was slightly infuriating (although secretly I was rather proud of him). And me? Well, I definitely found my inner artist. Unfortunately she’s a bit gaudy and rather heavy-handed on the colour front, but if you like your paintings slightly vulgar, then I’m happy to take commissions (prices on application). So, well done to Flavours. Thanks to you, a ratty, tired old couple came home with a some rather special holiday memories. Now, I’m not saying that any of mine are going on the wall, but a couple of Geof’s might make it into frames. In the meantime, I’m still doing it. My palette, brushes and delicious selection of multi-coloured pans (the little blocks of paint) are always to hand. I love the ritual of it. I like the way my breathing slows down when I have a brush in my hand. I might not be very good at painting but painting is very good for me.

The federal government will give Shoshana Hebshi $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks after armed agents forced her from a plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, made her undress during a search and held her for hours.

Won her case: Shoshana Hebshi, of Sylvania, Ohio, who was strip-searched at a Detroit-area airport, will gain $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated . Yoga instructor: Hebshi works as a freelance writer, yoga instructor, and is a mother to two twins . Hebshi, who has a Jewish mother and Saudi Arabian father, has said she was ethnically profiled based on her dark complexion. 'I filed this lawsuit because I didn't want others to experience the kind of unnecessary trauma that I did, and it has given me faith that the justice system can work to protect constitutional rights,' Hebshi said in a release. 'This settlement gives me some peace of mind. Now, I feel like I can finally put the incident behind me.' Hebshi of Sylvania, Ohio, was traveling home after visiting a sister in California when was removed from the Frontier Airlines flight after it landed Sept. 11, 2011. She was seated next to two Indian-American men, whom crew members had said spent a lot of time in the plane's bathroom. All three were detained, according to the ACLU.

Airport police 'acted quickly and responsibly, and followed appropriate protocols in responding to a request for help from one of our airline partners,' Authority Chief Executive Thomas Naughton said in a release. 'I strongly support their actions. We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.' As part of the settlement, Frontier will amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and provide all new employees with training on that revision. The airline also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given appropriate attention. Frontier Airlines declined to comment on the settlement. According to Hebshi's Twiiter, she is a mother of twin boys and works as a yoga instructor and freelance writer.

Djokovic lost his cool at the end of the second set as Murray came back to take the match to a decider but has since expressed his regret at the incident in a video posted on Facebook. During the rant, Djokovic snatched a towel from the shocked youngster before umpire Damien Dumusois gave him a code violation for the outburst, saying it 'didn't look good' as he sat down between the change of ends. Novak Djokovic issued an apology via Facebook to a ball boy he frightened during the Miami Open . Djokovic shouted at his backroom team after he lost the second set of the final to Andy Murray . The world No 1 grabbed a towel from the ball boy (right)  who seemed startled by the loud confrontation . He said: 'It's probably been the best start to a season aside from 2011 that I had in my career, and I can't be more grateful for all the support I'm getting from you guys and I'm enjoying my time playing and competing and hopefully I brought a smile to your faces. 'Also I want to reflect on a bad moment that happened in the final against Andy when I lost the second set. I yelled to my camp and my box in frustration. 'I saw the replay. Unfortunately a ball boy was in the middle of it and I really, really feel sorry and regret that he was there. There was absolutely no intention whatsoever to hurt him or scare him in any kind of way. I sincerely hope he forgives me. I really apologise.' Djokovic then extended his apology to the boy's parents. 'I do care about children a lot right now and I look at it in a much different way,' he added. 'So I want to apologise to his parents for this situation as well. As a father I wouldn't wish that something like this happens to my son. The youngster was standing between Djokovic and his backroom team during the heated exchange . 'Again I sincerely hope you can forgive me and that we can move on. Unfortunately sometimes the emotions get the better of you. 'Also times as a professional athlete you learn how to control them and how to stay composed and mentally strong. But on a hot day like this when Andy was playing well and pushing all my buttons it wasn't easy.' Djokovic was feeling the pressure after Murray fought back from a first set tie-break loss to win the second set in the blazing heat of Key Biscayne, Florida. But the outburst seemed to take Djokovic to another level as he rolled Murray 6-0 in the third to claim his fifth Miami Open title.

11457,c05bda9b387ec8ae43803170b6f59b4b82505db9,"(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Most of those released were women and children .

647,5c7493c6f28cfd58aa7b5f0e486e611307b4126d,"Hillary Clinton’s security detail arrived at a suburban Des Moines, Iowa fruit processing company on Tuesday with an added vehicle – a second Scooby. After her signature oversize black Chevy conversion van dropped her off at Capitol Fruit Company in Norwalk, Iowa, a visually identical GMC van drove up to the building with a nearly identical Secret Service escort vehicle. Both armored vehicles have raised roofs, deep-tinted windows and New York license plates. But while the original van – the one nicknamed 'Scooby' after the Scooby-Doo cartoon show – sports a mustard-yellow New York tag, the second has blue and white plates of a different design. Scroll down for video . WHY BUY ONE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE TWO AT TWICE THE PRICE? The first picture of both of Hillary Clinton's Scooby mobiles. One is a GMC and the other is a Chevrolet, but they are mechanically identical . CONVOY: Scooby-one and Scooby-two took up positions in Hillary's motorcade on a freeway near Des Moines . BACK SEAT DRIVER? Hillary Clinton climbs into the so-called Scooby van after a campaign stop at Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa . Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday . It’s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan . Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate’s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell. On Wednesday, the two Scooby vans arrived at Clinton's appointed location separately, but left together in a seven-car motorcade. UNDER GUARD: Two Secret Service agents with Scooby One in Iowa today . MOTORCADE: The Clinton convoy includes both Scooby vans and four black Suburbans, believed to all be Secret Service vehicles. It also included a white minivan on Wednesday . Scooby-Two’s driver brought up the rear, at enough of a distance to allow another car to pull in front of him. When that car stopped at a red light, the GMC van’s blue and red flashing lights came on. The stray car’s driver pulled to one side and Scooby-Two zoomed into the intersection, against the light . DECOYS: The Secret Service frequently deploys duplicates of aircraft and cars it uses to transport VIPs – including Marine One, the president's customized helicopter, which usually travels with two decoys .","Second modified, armored van spotted near Des Moines, Iowa alongside the one that Hillary Clinton travels in .

Pharoah saw the funny side of the incident and shared viewers’ tweets about the blunder on his own account. ‘The Project just played a a few clips for upcoming guest Michael Che and 2 of the clips were of Jay Pharoah #AWKWARD,’ tweeted Prue Knox. ‘Hey The Project, you do know that Michael Che and Jay Pharoah are two different people yeah? #ouch,’ Susan Bong tweeted, accompanied with a video of the gaffe.

10699,4dc06ca396df68b214798dc92c31808ab0dcb87a,"Steven Gerrard's hopes of a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career were shattered as his side suffered a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The final on May 30, also by coincidence Gerrard's 35th birthday, would have been the midfielder's final game in a Liverpool shirt before he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer, but - although he was handed a starting role by manager Brendan Rodgers - he was unable to influence the outcome. Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at Gerrard's performance at Wembley. Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard (left) competes for posession with Kieran Richardson . ROLE . Gerrard started the game in an advanced role behind Raheem Sterling and to the right of Philippe Coutinho in a 3-4-2-1 formation but midway through the first half, Liverpool adjusted their shape to 4-4-1-1, pushing Coutinho wide left and allowing Gerrard to adopt a more central position behind the striker. Rodgers tweaked Liverpool, and Gerrard's, shape for a third time at the interval, as the Reds went 4-3-2-1 with Gerrard playing deepest of the midfield three. Gerrard controls possession under pressure from Villa's Ashley Westwood at Wembley . Gerrard almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared off the line . POSSESSION . The first half largely passed Gerrard by as playing further forward starved him of any sustained spells of possession and Villa crowded out the space in front of their back four to good effect. Dropping back into central midfield after the interval allowed the Liverpool captain to collect the ball from his defenders but his passing was cautious and occasionally wayward. Gerrard was deployed in a number of different roles by Brendan Rodgers (right) throughout the contest . GOAL THREAT . Gerrard blazed a long-range effort over the bar shortly after half-time and curled a potentially dangerous free-kick into the hands of Shay Given midway through the second half. He almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared off the line. OVERALL . This was far from the fairytale ending Gerrard would have hoped for. The veteran looked confused by the various roles given to him by Rodgers and he failed to thrive in any of them.

6098,b39341c062db854a18fefb0f100976103705a086,"Just weeks after he controversially banned meat products from being sold at the Sydney Opera House during his upcoming shows there, Morrissey has once again weighed into Australian animal rights issues. The singer, who will be performing four sold-out shows as part of the Sydney Vivid Live festival in May, has written a public letter to The Just Group imploring them to cease their use of angora wool. The Australian retail giant, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur. Warning: graphic content . New campaign: Morrissey has written a letter to Australian retailer The Just Group imploring them to stop the use of angora wool . Brutal: PETA have successfully petitioned a number of Australian and international retailers to stop selling angora wool after revealing the horrific treatment of rabbits at Chinese angora farms . PETA Australia has been petitioning The Just Group to reconsider their position after successfully getting other retailers, including David Jones, Myer, Sportsgirl, General Pants Co, and Jeanswest, to stop selling angora. 'I'm looking forward to my concerts at the Sydney Opera House in May, but I was extremely dismayed to learn from my friends at PETA Australia that The Just Group refuse to modernise and drop angora wool from their clothing lines', Morrissey writes. 'By selling angora wool, you're sending the message to millions of shoppers that your company condone the barbaric abuse and slaughter of rabbits and are willing to perpetuate it.' Refusal: The Just Group, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur . Stance: The retailer has previously issued a statement on the controversy, simply saying: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group' The singer, 55, added that he would post petitions for concertgoers to sign at information booths throughout the Opera House if the company did not reverse their decision. Globally, major fashion chains including Zara, H&M, Marks & Spencer, and Gap have all pledged to not use the fur in recent years after PETA outed the heartbreaking conditions of angora rabbits. The organisation revealed the treatment of rabbits on angora farms in China, where workers rip the fur from live rabbits' skin. PETA alleges that the rabbits 'scream in pain' during the process. The Just Group are yet to respond to Daily Mail Australia's request for comment, however a spokesperson has previously responded to PETA with the statement: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group.' In February, Morrissey made headline when he ordered all food and bar outlets linked to the Opera House's Concert Hall remove meat products from their menus for the duration of his residency. Additionally, the former Smiths singer, who has been a non-meat eater since the age of 11, ordered that only vegetarian food be served backstage at the venue. Protest: Morrissey, 55, pledged to set up petition booths for attendees at his Sydney concerts to sign if The Just Group do not comply . The  Irish-born star, who says he sees 'no difference' between eating animals and paedophilia, they are both rape, violence, murder, -  will take to the stage during the festival of light and music on the 26th, 27th, 30th and 31st of May. Morrissey has never been shy about his views on meat eaters and has categorically said 'If I'm introduced to anyone who eats beings, I walk away.' He briefly walked off-stage at Coachella in 2009, complaining about the smell from the nearby food concession area, saying 'The smell of burning animals is making me sick'. Last month he banned burgers and hot dogs from Belfast's the Odyssey Arena for his performance. And he recently ditched a scheduled concert in Iceland when the venue refused to grant his no meat requests the night of his gig. In concert: The Irish-born musician has also banned the sale of meat products at the Opera House for the duration of his residency for the Vivid festival in May . Last year, during a Q&A session on his fan site, True To You, he replied to a groupie's question saying: 'I see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia... 'Imagine, for example, if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you ""Hello, I enjoy bloodshed, throat-slitting and the destruction of life,"" well, I doubt if you'd want to exchange phone numbers.' In another post, he wrote of TV chef Jamie Oliver: 'If Jamie 'Orrible is so certain that flesh-food is tasty then why doesn't he stick one of his children in a microwave?' The animal activist is equally known for his outspoken political views and hatred of the British monarchy. He once said in an outspoken interview in 1984 of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: 'She is only one person. She can be destroyed. It is the only remedy for this country at the moment.' British police responded by searching Morrissey's home and carrying out an official investigation. Daily Mail Australia have contacted The Just Group for comment.","Morrissey wrote a letter to Australian retailer The Just Group .

The tune, which sounds somewhat like an 80s rock ballad actually translates as 'I will fight for the Fillipino' and will be played ahead of the richest fight in history against the undefeated American at the MGM Grand on May 2. Multi-talented Pacquiao not only wrote and sang the tune but also directed the music video . The video also carries a nostalgic feel, featuring a leather-clad Pacquiao crooning into the microphone Band-Aid style while a montage of his various fights and humanitarian efforts fade in and out. Whether Mayweather has called on his close friend and cheerleader Justin Bieber to come up with his own entrance song has not been confirmed. The boxing champion's song 'Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino' translates as 'I will fight for the Fillipino' The 80s style music video includes a montage of Pacquiao's fights and his humanitarian efforts . Meanwhile, the 36-year-old decided to train on the streets of Los Angeles on Friday as he ran along the trail at Griffith Park joined by several fitness fanatics. As well as working on his aerobic endurance, Pacquiao was also tested on his core strength and showed off his impressive footwork in front of watching spectators by shadow boxing. Pacquiao recently unveiled the multicoloured mouth guard he will wear during his $300million Las Vegas showdown with Mayweather. The container that it comes in reads 'MouthGuards for Champions', demonstrating Pacquiao's undoubted confidence. Pacquiao was joined by his dog Pacman as he ran around one of North America's largest urban parks . Pacquiao has revealed the colourful mouthpiece he will wear during the May 2 bout in Las Vegas . I always ask in my mind why do we have to judge what you feel? What should be the right basis so they can listen to us? Do we have to be in a good status? Even if i hurt myself, i still wanted to keep it within me and just be silent about it. Even if my heart aches, its nothing to me as long as people from my country show their smiles and felt happy. I will fight the whole world for my country bringing your name . I'm a Pinoy. We are Pinoy . I will fight the world with my life at stake. I will fight for all Filipino . Even us, has our own dreams for our country . To help fellow countrymen, and give pride for our very own country . It doesn't matter who you are. Poor or rich if for the country we all fight together. I will fight the whole world for my country bringing your name . I'm a Pinoy. We are Pinoy. I will fight the world with my life at stake. I will fight for all Filipino . I will fight, I will fight . I will fight the whole world for my country bringing your name . I'm a Pinoy. We are Pinoy. I will fight the world with my life at stake.

1683,131effae07cdb7ebc21527fe7def467c38e02b0a,"Sitting with a set of felt-tip pens and a book full of black line drawings just waiting to be filled is most children's idea of heaven. But now thanks to an illustrator and designer from Tenby, West Wales, colouring in is the latest stress-busting hobby for adults. Millie Marotta, 36, is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume Animal Kingdom, filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes, patterns and shapes. Scroll down for video . Embellished elephant: Millie Marotta's colouring book features an array of intricate designs, including this elephant . Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustration in Animal Kingdom . The beautiful black and white book is made up of detailed line illustrations of animals, plants and birds and encourages users to 'add your own touches with colours or line drawing.' And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book. 'This is why I would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market.' This coloured-in image of a dragonfly taken out of Animal Kingdom shows the vibrant level of detail . An image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna . Millie has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin books and Marks & Spencer, but it's her best-selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame. In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world. A bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of Millie's illustrations . This blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in . Millie worked from her studio in Tenby, Wales, to create her range of detailed illustrations . 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress. A little bit of escapism if you like.' And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic . The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at £3.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list . The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings . Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations . She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'","Millie Marotta's book, Animal Kingdom, features detailed line illustrations .

6676,5de4dd6f1c851137f0362f81cf67da88e389c935,"An artist with a penchant for snapping urban architecture has come up with an innovative new way of making the most of his photography. French photographer and illustrator, Thomas Lamadieu, takes snaps of the sky in courtyards and built-up areas to create a frame of buildings. The space in between then acts as a canvas for his playful illustrations which he has dubbed 'sky art'. On his website Thomas says that his artistic aim is to 'show a different perception of urban architecture and the everyday environment around us, what we can construct with a boundless imagination'. Before and after: Lamadieu's original  shot (left) and after it is transformed into 'sky art' (right) Lamadieu, who is also known as Roots Art, is based in France but travels the world to photograph the space between buildings in various cities. In the past year alone he has visited Belgium, Germany, Canada, the United States and South Korea in his quest to find the perfect sky canvases for his illustrations. Since he began creating sky art in 2011,  Lamadieu has made a name for himself among critics, art lovers and journalists all around the world. Speaking to the Independent, Lamadieu said: 'The sky drawings series really started with as a way of playing with my imagination to show how these seemingly empty spaces in the urban environment could be reinterpreted in different and creative ways.' 'The bearded man in my images stands for the sky itself, the big man in the sky, but it’s not meant to be religious in any way'. Surreal: Three characters draw their own illustrations in an inverted sky shot . Upside down: A bearded figure rides a cat in between the buildings . Peace out: An illustration of a man playing an electric guitar fills the sky space in this photograph . Cheshire cat: A drawing of a couple embracing behind a grinning cat fills the gap where the sky would have originally been . Using a fish-eye lens camera to capture the perfect vertical shot, Thomas Lamadieu then illustrates the graphic shape created between buildings using Microsoft Paint. These abstract canvases depict a collection of humorous characters and surreal scenes. One inverted upshot depicts three bearded men drawing a picture of the night sky; meanwhile another shows a woman with hair not dissimilar to that of Marge Simpson reclining between two buildings. Self portrait? A man spray painting clouds on a canvas fills the skyscape in this photograph taken in a courtyard . Twit twoo: A black and white illustration of an owl looks down upon this oval shaped void . Thumbs up: An image of a man holding a Polaroid of a smiling cloud is superimposed onto a shot of town houses . A signature Lamadieu figure appears to be a bearded man in a Breton striped top who features in various guises throughout the 'sky art' images. In one picture he appears as a giant rock star wielding an electric guitar, and in another he has a camera around his neck whilst presenting a Polaroid of a cloud. As well as surrealism, optical illusion is also a key theme in Lamadieu's work - these confusing images combining photography with clever illustration are certainly hard to get your head around. Jack in the box: An illustration of a masked man holding a Jack in the box toy overlooks this snap between two brick buildings and a washing line . Optical illusion: This sky shot has been transformed into a clever optical illusion thanks to Lamadieu's illustration . One image that plays a trick on the eye is a vertical sky photograph combined with a horizontal illustration of a game of cat and mouse to mind-boggling affect. Similarly, an image of a bearded man in a striped top holding some cloud shaped balloons creates a trompe l'oeil that the facade of the building is a pavement with illustrated figures superimposed on it. Meanwhile, the sky becomes the sea in another illustrated image of a man on a boat surrounded by circling sharks. Trompe l'oeil: It's difficult to tell which way is up thanks to this clever and confusing illustration . Sea-ing double: The distorted angle of this photo combined with sea illustration make it a mind-bending photo to look at .

De Gea has been in fantastic form this season, while Real's legendary stopper Iker Casillas has long been seen as unreliable. Although the European champions would like to sign De Gea this June, they are looking at the possibility of picking up Chelsea's Petr Cech to fill the gap in between, while the Spaniard runs down his contract at Old Trafford, which expires next year. Real Madrid's attempt to nab David De Gea is the big story in AS, while Marca focus on James Rodriguez . In a move that Spanish paper AS calls 'Operation De Gea', the paper claims Real are only prepared to pay for the keeper if United 'fix a reasonable price' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year. De Gea's contract is up at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016, and he is yet to sign a new deal, with United still uncertain of Champions League football for next season. Cech, meanwhile, looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Czech keeper likely to command a fee of around £10million. Elsewhere in Spain the focus is on Lionel Messi's injury, which is still causing him some problems ahead of Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo on Sunday. Sport say 'Messi is OK', with the news that 'all tests were positive' on his injured foot, and Marca add that the Barca star has 'overcome the pain'. Lionel Messi's injury dominates in Sport, while in Italy there is more news on Palermo's Paulo Dybala . However, the Madrid-based paper also report that 'he still can’t put his boot on' because of the injury to his metatarsal. There is better news for James Rodriguez, who is also set to return from injury, with Marca reporting that he will start for Real Madrid on Sunday, his first game for 59 days. In Italy there are reports that Palermo striker Paulo Dybala, who has been linked with Arsenal, could join up with former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan. Corriere dello Sport reports that Inter are ready to offer £22million for the Argetinian youngster.","David De Gea is yet to extend his contract beyond 2016 .

But now Bon Apetit has come up with a genius way to revive your stale loaf and it involves running it under the tap. And whilst it might sound like an unusual move, they promise that this trick will revive your crusty old bread before dinner time. Bon Apetit have revealed that the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread is to run it under water before baking it in the oven . The first step they suggest is to take your stale bread and run it under your tap. It doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold but you should try to keep the cut edge away from the direct flow of water. Then turn your oven on to a warm temperature - around 150 degrees - and stick the bread inside. For a small loaf you need to allow around 6-7 minutes and for a large, or particularly wet one, around 12 to 13 minutes. The experts say it works because: 'The water turns to steam, which rehydrates the bread’s crumb, or interior, while the heat of the oven firms up the crust.' When you have wet your bread put it in the oven for between 6 and 13 minutes depending on how large and how wet the loaf is . Femail spoke to Lifesum nutritionist Luvisa Nilsson who said that the water trick does actually work, but you must make sure to eat the bread that same day. 'Whilst there might not be any obvious health risks whilst using the water/heat method, it is beneficial not to waste food,' she said.' 'Once you have put your ‘watered’ bread in the oven or microwave, make sure you eat it within the day, as the warmth and damp may potentially harbour bacteria. Nutritionist Luvisa Nillson says that you should be careful to check that your bread is not mouldy and make sure to eat it within one day . She continued: 'There is however a difference between stale and mouldy bread, and you must watch out for mould. 'Bread should be disposed off if it has orange, green, yellow or black spots as these can be harmful to your gut and cause severe discomfort and stomach ache. 'When bread goes stale it is usually a good sign that It is about to go mouldy, so give the bread a thorough check before consuming.'","Bon Apetit have revealed the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread .

7516,596bced0d8ee1c0ceb6bddaa5cbb1f3dcd98ce3e,"Samantha says she thinks she's 'fabulous' I sprung out of bed this morning and examined myself in the full-length bedroom mirror, and I can honestly say that there’s never a day when I would rather be someone else. The woman looking back at me? She’s gorgeous, intelligent and fabulous! Quite simply, I adore who I am – inside and out. I’m no narcissist – I’m perfectly aware I have flaws, but they’re deliciously wrapped up in the very unique moi. I’ve grown to love my nose that tilts ever so slightly to the right, my hourglass figure that boasts slightly-too-large hips, and my green-sometimes-grey eyes. I’m a size 10, but even so I could do with dropping 10lbs. But as long as I don’t mind, who cares? Which is why I’m utterly peeved about Dove's latest campaign results. How humiliating to film women in a public place ‘choosing’ to walk through a door marked either ‘beautiful’ or ‘average’. Talk about putting the meeker sex on the spot. It's hardly a big surprise the survey discovered 96 per cent of women chose the 'average' option. From my experience, most women would rather strut out in public as naked as the day they were born than  freely admit that not only are they good-looking, but they’re also (whisper it) beautiful. Why is this? Numerous university studies have been carried out (I know this because their authors send them to me) and they have all come up with the same conclusion – it’s self-protection. If women don’t fit in with their (usually older, fatter, less attractive) female peers, then those who are good-looking won’t get hired for jobs by the fairer sex; their careers will stall if their boss is female and they’ll routinely receive their P45 for nothing more heinous than boasting a lovely smile. And this is what really exasperates me: it isn’t society that won’t let us admit that we’re beautiful – it’s the very same members of our own sex who hold us back. Even though I’m an un-Botoxed, un-surgically enhanced 44-year-old, I would have marched through the entrance marked beautiful without giving it a second thought. I’m extremely comfortable in my skin. Haters: Samantha has received death threats for standing up and saying 'I'm beautiful' This confidence annoys the heck out of other women. You might have read what I’ve written about this problem, in an article published in April 2012. It received almost 5,000 comments online and suddenly I was a global name. The earth turned on its axis as one woman - me - was up for admitting: ‘I like how I look and other women have a problem with it.’ Since then I’ve been ridiculed, received death threats, told I’m off my rocker. Just last week I received yet another email from a woman titled ‘please read me’ which went on at length to tell me I was ‘an arrogant, cocky woman’. Little wonder only four per cent of women were brave enough to walk through a door marked 'beautiful' in the Dove campaign. Critical: Samantha claims Dove's campaign works because it exploits our need to act modestly . My personal take on this experiment is devastatingly simple: we’d rather fit in and humiliate ourselves by claiming to be average than give our fellow 'fairer' sex any more ammunition than we've got already against each other. My view is supported by the thousands of emails I’ve received over the years from women routinely humiliated, bullied and singled out by their female peers for daring to think they look good. The emails depressingly cover the same ground wherever they live in the world. Whether they’re teenagers at school in the US, middle-aged mums in Australia or women in the workplace in the UK: if they rate themselves, display confidence, or dare to say they look good they get bullied or socially ostracised. A recent plea from a young women in how to deal with her critics was this: . ‘I have just looked up your article, it’s my life in black and white. I tried dressing down, not wearing too much make up, unfashionable clothes and flat shoes. Reaching out: Samantha receives letters from teens who get bullied for being beautiful . 'I am confident and friendly, men open doors for me, they are polite. But some women are awful to me as a result of it. 'I am fed up with it, angry about it, annoyed with it. I feel like a complete nothing and nobody; maybe that’s what I should be to be accepted.’ Another woman was banned by her mean-minded (older) female boss for wearing heels to work: they were a ‘health hazard’. What health and safety offense could she cause wearing stilettos while working as a receptionist? The mind boggles. How awful that these women are treated this way. It's little wonder so many of the fairer sex refuse to acknowledge that they are good-looking, which is ironic because so many do it in private – behind the anonymity of social media. We know how to photograph ourselves well thanks to selfies and social media sites such as Instagram. We can iron out wrinkles, banish zits, magically award ourselves a thigh gap or hip dip. In the Dove campaign, women were asked to choose between a door marked 'beautiful' or 'average' Yet to admit to the world ‘yeah, I look good’ means we risk incurring the wrath of other women. We have to be display modesty at all times - which is why Dove's campaign works brilliantly. I’m not some superior Type A female who doesn’t recognise that there are some who don’t feel happy about themselves. Yet such feelings of low self-esteem seem to go hand in hand with the desire to criticise and target others in order to restore an illusion of self worth. Any female trolls ousted usually blame their behaviour on a crisis of confidence. Ironically, they are the only ones who can help themselves - but picking on others isn't the way to go about it. In 2015, we desperately need a seismic shift in female societal thinking so that women can say loud and proud that they’re beautiful - and not fear reprisals. Otherwise cynical advertising campaigns - in a bid to flog toiletries - will continue to exploit us just like this one has 'beautifully' done.","Author of 'Why women hate me for being beautiful' article speaks out .

7834,31a8ee43766fdfdd0784f398dd970280a5d58537,"A student has become an online sensation after powering his Cambridge college to glory in the final of University Challenge. Ted Loveday managed to answer 10 starter questions in the last round of the BBC quiz show, helping Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge defeat Magdalen College, Oxford. Viewers were astounded by his general knowledge prowess - but the law student has now admitted that he had help from some unlikely sources. Scroll down for video . Star: Ted Loveday has powered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to victory in University Challenge . Mr Loveday revealed after his team's triumph that they had revised for the programme by watching YouTube videos and researching possible questions on Wikipedia. Gonville and Caius won the University Challenge title by amassing 225 points against Magdalen in the final, broadcast on BBC Two on Monday night. The team's victory was largely thanks to Mr Loveday, who provided the correct response to 10 'starter for 10' questions posed by presenter Jeremy Paxman. His range of expert topics ranged from foreign languages to economics and politics, via science and classical music. In the wake of the team's win, University Challenge viewers took to the internet to express their admiration for Mr Loveday - and the cable-knit jumpers he sported on screen. Team: The Cambridge students thrashed their opponents from Magdalen College, Cambridge . Quizmaster: The BBC Two show is hosted by Jeremy Paxman, notorious for his aggressive putdowns . 1) 'This long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we're all dead.' These are the words of which economist? 2) 'They illustrate the temper of a pre-revolutionary age, when there is widespread desire for moderate reform.' These words of Bertrand Russell refer to which two figures of the northern Renaissance born respectively in London and Rotterdam? 3) What five-letter word means a stupid or silly woman in Mexican Spanish, a university canteen in German and in the English-speaking world an organisation founded in 1946 for people with high IQs? 4) During the 20th century, which Conservative Prime Minister's cabinet included that party's previous and subsequent Prime Ministers, both of whom served for the whole of its period in office, the former as Foreign Secretary and the latter as Secretary of State for Education? 5) 'The first known instance of the application of algorithmic thinking to a field outside logic and mathematics.' These words refer to a grammar of which language by the Gandharian scholar Panini? 6) Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter is an autobiographical work by which French author? It recounts her stifling and respectable upbringing and how she revolted against it at the Sorbonne with Jean-Paul Sartre. 7) Inspired by the artworks of Viktor Hartmann, 'The Gnome', 'The Hut on Fowl's Legs' and 'The Great Gate of Kiev' are among the 10 movements that comprise which suite by Mussorgsky? 8) John F Kennedy's statement that 'mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind' is an example of what figure of speech named after the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet? 9) From the Greek for 'unguent', what five-letter term denotes a complex of molten silicates with water and gases formed within the upper mantle of the earth? 10) Meaning 'said only once', what two-word Greek term denotes a word or word-form that is recorded only once in a text, in the work of a particular author, or in a body of literature? Scroll down to see the answers . Matt Stephens wrote on Twitter, 'Cable-knit jumper in excelsis,' while Jack Clayton added: 'After that performance, Loveday is going to be fighting off the groupies with a trident.' Paul Coxon, a Cambridge physicist, made a reference to the contestant's constant sips of water, joking: 'Loveday needs to drink so much water because he IS ON FIRE.' Mr Loveday even made an appearance on a blog called 'University Challenge Cuties', which said he was 'the definition of a UC cutie'. Speaking after his team's victory, Mr Loveday revealed that he had used the internet to finesse his quizzing skills ahead of filming - and suggested that University Challenge is not as intellectual as it might seem. 'We'd put aside regular times to sit down together in the college bar, watch past episodes on YouTube and try to shout the answers at the telly before any of the contestants buzzed,' he told the Gonville and Caius website. That was really helpful for improving our reaction speeds. 'Sometimes question-setters really like a particular area and they'll keep coming back to it. For instance, they're a bit obsessed with Pre-Raphaelite paintings, so we binged on some Wikipedia articles to make sure we were familiar with them. It paid off because we had a whole picture round on the Pre-Raphaelites! 'University Challenge isn't about deep understanding - it's about very wide, superficial knowledge combined with quick recall.' He also revealed that Jeremy Paxman treats the show's contestants generously despite his fierce reputation - Mr Loveday said: 'He knows you're just students and doesn't expect you to be as tough as the politicians he interviews. 'Having said that, he can be needlessly harsh in his put-downs to losing teams.' The quiz champion offered some advice for other students hoping to follow in his footsteps, saying that the key to success is simply watching the show and looking up the answers when necessary. 'I know some of the questions on the show can seem fairly intimidating and high-brow,' he said. 'But there's no magic secret to it - all the answers will be out there on Wikipedia somewhere. 'If you find a question daunting, look it up online and read about the answer. Next time it comes up, it won't be daunting any more.' Mr Loveday grew up in west London and went to Latymer Upper School, a leading private school in Hammersmith. This year was not the first time he tried to appear on University Challenge - last year he applied for the Gonville and Caius team, but did not make the cut. He follows in the footsteps of other notable champions such as Gail Trimble, who impressed even Mr Paxman when she captained Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2009. Almost: Stephen Fry came second in the 1980 edition of University Challenge with Queens' College, Cambridge . For many University Challenge contestants, winning the show is a prelude to a successful career. But an unlucky few never reach the same heights again, and end up unable to make the most of their talents - or worse. Tony Gillham, who won the show in 2003 as a member of the Birkbeck College team, struggled with alcoholism after his victory. He said that he was even drunk while competing in the quiz - and suggested that winning was a poisoned chalice, because it convinced him that he could function properly despite his drinking. John Burke, a champion in 1999, ended up working as a postman despite his intellectual firepower. Six years ago he told a documentary: 'I'm certainly capable of a lot more than just delivering bits of paper. I've got a lot of other capabilities and I'm not really fulfilling my potential.' Champions to have found success after their University Challenge days include Kwasi Kwarteng and David Lidington, both Conservative MPs, who each won the contest while studying at Cambridge. Comedian Stephen Fry came close to joining their ranks in the quiz elite when he was part of the Queens' College, Cambridge team which came second in 1980. THE ANSWERS: 1) John Maynard Keynes; 2) Erasmus and Thomas More; 3) Mensa; 4) Ted Heath; 5) Sanskrit; 6) Simone de Beauvoir; 7) Pictures of an Exhibition; 8) Chiasmus; 9) Magma; 10) Hapax legomenon .","Ted Loveday led Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to the University Challenge title this week .

And now Cheryl Prudham, a pregnant mother of 11, is blowing some of that cash on a £10,000 trip to Las Vegas, it was reported yesterday. The 33-year-old is said to be planning to renew her wedding vows with her husband Robert, 30, during the ‘no expense spared’ jaunt. Shameless: Cheryl Prudham, 33, who receives £39,000 in benefits, and her partner Robert are spending £10,000 on a lavish ceremony in Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows . Browsing: The couple, who hit headlines last year after demanding a bigger council house for their huge brood, visited her local Thomson travel agents in Kent to book the luxury family break . The pair, who have only just got back together after a short split because they want to have more children, were photographed this week visiting their local Thomson travel agent and taking away brochures for the American casino city. Mrs Prudham – who was also recently spotted flaunting an £895 Mulberry handbag as she strolled near their home in Gravesend, Kent – plans to wear a £1,000 designer gown for the ceremony. The couple will stay at the Circus Circus hotel and intend to renew their vows at the infamous Chapel of Love, before being whisked away in a chauffeur-driven limousine. They have also booked to see some shows and go on a helicopter tour across Nevada, a Sunday newspaper reported. It is not their first taxpayer-funded jaunt. Last year they took a £7,000 trip to Menorca, Spain. Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine at the time: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.’ The Prudhams claim £39,192 in benefits a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – bringing their total annual income up to almost £60,000. Planning: The duo are planning to fly to the U.S. in March for the two-week 'no-expense spared' break . Lavish: Last month, Mr and Mrs Prudham and some of their children were spotted leaving a designer shop in London . They managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year cap on state handouts because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. The pair separated for a short time after Mr Prudham, who is the father of Mrs Prudham’s five youngest children, struck up a relationship with another woman online. But Mrs Prudham took him back in February because she wanted to have more children with him. She said: ‘We’re good at making babies ... and I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.’ Her 12th child is due in July and the family, who live in a five-bedroom council house, are waiting to be upgraded to a seven-bedroom home because their current one is ‘too cramped’. Last month, the family attracted attention over their lifestyle when they were photographed leaving a Mulberry store at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London. The brand’s handbags are seen as the height of luxury thanks to the fine leather used and the eye-watering prices to match. Mrs Prudham left the store with a shopping bag – thought to contain the much-coveted £895 Bayswater handbag she was recently spotted with. Happy families: The couple have been together six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife’s five youngest children . Huge brood: The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000 .","Cheryl Prudham, 33, from Kent, planning to renew vows with husband Rob .

5013,28bc2f9dc0ce698b34ed7b27d0a88239a3b934e1,"Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is convinced there is more to come from striker Harry Kane after seeing him plunder his 30th goal of the season. Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker to reach the 30-mark with a late strike in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Newcastle on Sunday. However, Pochettino is convinced the 21-year-old England hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game. Harry Kane calmly slots Tottenham's third goal in time added on after coming one-on-one with Krul . Kane celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as Spurs claim a 3-1 win over Newcastle . He said: 'He has big potential. He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'It's a fantastic achievement and I congratulate him. He deserves this moment because he has worked a lot. It's an historic thing. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' If it was Kane who put the icing on the cake at St James' Park, it was Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen who paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned Newcastle to a sixth successive league defeat. Chadli fired them in front on the half-hour and after Jack Colback had levelled 20 seconds after the restart, Eriksen scored with a free-kick which evaded all the yellow shirts in the middle and defeated keeper Tim Krul. Kane killed off any hopes of a second fightback when he rounded off a 91st-minute break to leave Pochettino delighted. Tottenham striker Kane at full stretch as he is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . Kane celebrates his goal against Newcastle as opposition goalkeeper Tim Krul looks on in despair . He said: 'We fully deserved the victory and the three points. I think our performance was better than Newcastle's and I am very pleased for our players. 'I am happy to recover this feeling after the last two games - that wasn't good and it's important to feel victory again.' It proved a difficult day for opposite number John Carver, whose side had to contend not only with Tottenham, but a boycott by some of their own fans. Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Vernon Anita . Carver insisted that had little impact - the official attendance at the 52,000-capacity stadium was 47,427 - but admitted the Magpies, who are currently seven points clear of the drop zone, are engaged in a survival fight. He said: 'Absolutely, we're in amongst it, there's no danger of that, because you have got sides - and I'll use Leicester as an example - who are winning games. We aren't. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise . Newcastle players join Colback as the hard-working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the area . 'But we have got to find a way of trying to find some points and put some points on the board. We have to come up with a solution, I have to come up with a solution. 'I have to find a method of trying to play now that might not be pretty on the eye, but I need to find a way of getting some results, getting some points. People might not like what they see, but I'm going to have to do it.' Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at home . Fans applaud Newcastle's goals while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, Not Ashley' sign during the game . Geordie Carver was installed as Alan Pardew's replacement until the end of the season in January, and has found himself in the firing line virtually ever since, although he is refusing to throw in the towel. He said: 'It's probably the most difficult situation I have ever been in. But I'm a fighter and I'm not going to shirk anything. I'll take the stick and I'll take the responsibility because that's the type of person I am. 'But I'm not going to give up on it. Yes, I'm angry and I'm annoyed, and I've got my own thoughts in my head that will stay private. But I have just got to get on with it because nobody else is going to do it.'

3519,2beb3c90dd9c2fe8288f352b6b973b5a0b5dd0dc,"(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: ""I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,"" and ""I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here."" And, finally, ""Lose some weight, baby girl."" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and ""ugly on the inside"" to a ""sad, self-hating coward."" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded . These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online . Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the ""power of the press"" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and ""the return of class"" -- who express views like, ""Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.","Video shows ESPN reporter Britt McHenry berating and belittling a tow company worker .

The snapshot, which shows the man giving the peace sign as he flaunts his controversial shirt  at the festival held in Indio, California, sparked outrage after it was shared on Twitter on Sunday by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor of Vice's music and culture channel Thump. 'This guy wins the award for worst fashion/lifestyle choices @coachella. I'm not easy to offend, but this is sh**** [sic],' he tweeted along with the picture. Tasteless choice: An unidentified concert goer has come under fire for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words 'Eat Sleep Rape Repeat' (pictured) to Coachella on Sunday . First person account: The offensive photograph was shared by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor for Vice's music and culture channel Thump . The distasteful choice of words on the concert goer's shirt are thought to be a play on the Fatboy Slim song Eat Sleep Rave Repeat, which was released in 2013. '@JemayelK I thought at first this said ""eat sleep rave repeat"" until I read it carefully. Wtf [sic],' one critic commented on Jemayel's post. Another added: '@JemayelK @hannahgais @coachella can't even understand why someone would think that's funny... Or wearable in public [sic].' There were some who were willing to give the unidentified man the benefit of the doubt however, suggesting that the image may have been edited in order to make the garment appear more offensive than it actually was. Shameful shirt: Many commenters on Twitter wrote that they were shocked that someone would wear such an offensive top in public . Misspelling: Sam Houston questioned whether the shirt was real or not, hoping that the unidentified male's shirt was meant to say 'Rage' instead of 'Rape' Shout out: Meanwhile, Ben Gomori chose to insult the wearer of the shirt, calling him a 'F****** p****' '@JemayelK @coachella Is that real? I imagine it was meant to say “RAGE”? [sic],' one critic asked, while someone else added: '@JemayelK please say that's photoshopped?? [sic]' But Jemayel confirmed that he had taken the snapshot and seen the shirt with his own two eyes after one Twitter user asked: 'Before I jump on the appropriate rage wagon, did you take this picture yourself?' 'Yeah I did. Rage away,' he replied. The shirt, which doesn’t appear to be sold online, may have been custom-made for the event. Meanwhile, someone else confirmed that another Coachella reveler had taken to Twitter on Sunday to share their disgust after running into the man in the controversial T-shirt. Fashion faux pas: Another Twitter user revealed that she also saw the man wearing the controversial T-shirt . Shake it off: But not everyone was upset by the shirt. This person criticized Jemayel and told him to focus on 'real issues' 'The most inappropriate shirt at #Coachella goes to the guy wearing one that says ""Eat Sleep Rape Repeat"" - what the actual f***? [sic]' she wrote. Although not everyone agreed with a majority of the public's outrage. One Twitter commented on Jemayel's photo, writing: 'If this offends you, you're a p****. Grow a sack and focus on real issues, not feminist honeypot garbage.' Amid the debate over the questionable T-shirt, the first weekend of Coachella came to a close last night after Madonna planted a kiss on Drake, who looked horrified after the impromptu make-out session. The music festival will start again on Friday with performances from ACDC, Azealia Banks, Alabama Shakes and more.

The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air.

Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.","Clip shows mysterious black cloud hanging over the village of Shortandy .

It may be time to consider a short, sharp trip to the suburbs of Beijing. Here, in a collection of drab, concrete buildings surrounding a large courtyard is a military-style bootcamp designed with one thing in mind: to treat victims of a very modern disease — a compulsive addiction to electronic gadgets. Formed in 2006, the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre (IATC) has so far welcomed 6,000 mostly young, mostly male patients — and claims to have ‘cured’ 75 per cent of them. Scroll down for video . Hooked up: With wires hanging from his head, a young boy undergoes electroencephalogram scans to measure brain activity.

Smart salute: At the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre, it’s time to put down that mouse, pull on a camouflage T-shirt and learn to click heels, not screen icons . The man behind the facility is Tao Ran, a doctor and colonel in the People’s Liberation Army, regarded as China’s leading expert in wangyin, or internet addiction, which is said by the country’s government to affect 24 million of its 632 million internet users. He describes wangyin as a form of mental illness, saying that 90 per cent of his patients are clinically depressed from a lack of normal social interaction. Many have back and eyesight problems due to spending up to 14 hours a day staring at screens, and a third suffer from eating disorders. ‘Internet addiction leads to problems in the brain similar to those derived from heroin consumption but, generally, it’s even more damaging,’ Mr Ran said recently. ‘It destroys relationships and deteriorates the body without the person knowing.’ To break it, Mr Ran confiscates all electronic devices from patients and forces them to follow a super-strict, military-style fitness regime, starting with parade drills at 6.30 each morning. They must also endure occasional spells in solitary confinement and take regular medication. Progress is monitored by psychiatric assessments and regular brain scans. Mr Ran only considers someone cured if, six months after their release, they use the internet for fewer than six hours per day. Some critics have called the techniques brutal. But they also yield results and there is high demand for places: the IATC, which charges £1,000 per month (more than twice the average Chinese urban worker’s wage) recently expanded, so it can treat 130 patients at any one time. Work that body: Military-style drills, exercises and weekly tai chi sessions help the young addicts to shed their indoor pallor . Open wide: A nurse checks that 14-year-old Yin Yu Tao has taken his medication — all part of the £1,000-a-month bootcamp . It isn’t alone: there are around 300 such clinics in China, due largely to an explosion in the popularity of online games such as World Of Warcraft. Many internet cafes have beds, so customers can sleep at their keyboards, and Shanghai recently passed a law forcing parents to stop minors ‘being overindulgent with online and electronic games’. Meanwhile in Japan, where Facebook and Twitter are national obsessions, there are dozens of so-called internet ‘fasting camps’. Taiwan is also facing up to internet addiction — in January, its government voted to fine parents who allow children to spend ‘excessive time using electronic products’.

Former Destrehan High School teacher Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends at the St Charles Parish, Louisiana school that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house.

Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana.

It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays. Both Dufresne and Respess were suspended from their jobs without pay following their arrests last fall.","Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September when a student at the high school she taught at started bragging about sleeping with two teachers .

Professor John Warren discovered avocado trees switch from male to female in a matter of hours . The flowers close for the night and then the next morning they reopen - but now they use their 'male anthers' to spread their pollen.

8722,513c24f2caf618ee196d03170ea8c77a7913171d,"For Inverness the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one, but two, plot-changing twists. One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic . Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point . 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller . Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final . 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful . There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'","Josh Meekings handball should have been a penalty and a red card .

3790,b3b892e834f738e5de92d46fa267cc27837262f6,"As manager of Rangers, Stuart McCall has learned to tolerate supporters booing their own players. Growing up watching Leeds United, he was less forgiving. 'I remember Terry Yorath and Ray Hankin coming in for stick,' he recalled. 'As a teenager I used to get into fights because of it. 'I remember standing at the back of Leeds kop, maybe I was 15 or 16 year old and Yorath and Hankin were getting booed. Terry Yorath had just taken over from Billy Bremner and it was boooooo… . Rangers manager Stuart McCall has had to get used to his players being booed by supporters . Lee McCulloch, the Rangers captain, was booed for an error that led to a goal against Raith Rovers . McCall hopes that for the time that he is manager of Rangers, McCulloch will be the last player to get booed . 'They had a song for Ray Hankin and it went: 'Ray Hankin, Ray Hankin' and half of them would then shout: 'S**t' and this is while he was warming up for the game. 'That's when I got into fights, with the people shouting s**t. 'Tell me, how's that going to help any individual when that's the reaction to their name just being read out?' Those sour memories returned last weekend when Rangers skipper Lee McCulloch was the object of frustration from the Ibrox stands. Culpable for a Raith Rovers goal, the veteran defender suffered the embarrassment of being booed by his own supporters. He was hardly the first to suffer that fate. So long as McCall remains manager of Rangers – an unknown currently – he hopes McCulloch will be the last. 'I've no problem with a team being booed off at half time or full time, that's fine. People pay their money. 'But I think the individual thing is not on. It was sad to hear last week. 'The good thing was that within minutes of it happening most of the supporters actually turned it round and he was getting backing again. 'We were losing 2-0 and I think people thought: 'You know what, we need to help the team.' It spun itself round and then the majority of the supporters were clapping. 'If it hadn't turned itself round, I don't think we would've got back in the game.' In the west of Scotland, grown men rarely express their feelings. To sympathise would only have drawn attention to the captain's predicament. McCulloch has made no reference to the incident to McCall and vice versa. 'He just wants to get on with it,' added the manager. 'There's not a lot you can say anyway. 'I remember a situation with Michael Higdon at Motherwell. I had to put out a message saying: 'Lay off.' He ended up with 27 goals and player of the year. 'It doesn't help anybody if a player is booed. Yes, we all understand and accept frustration in the stands. But booing one of your own players isn't going to help. 'I fully accept that when you boo your team at half time and full time that's everyone's prerogative. But it's certainly not going to help anyone by scapegoating an individual. 'Is it going to make him feel good and feel like he's going to flourish or is he going to go into himself? Surely that's common sense.' Should McCulloch play against Hearts at Tynecastle on Saturday– and the indications are he will – the defiant, thrawn streak in away supporters will no doubt prompt a different response. Such is the must-win nature of the game and the raucous Gorgie atmosphere that an exaggerated show of support is likely. McCall expects the 36-year-old - a strong, experienced footballer - to be fine. 'Lee has a leadership mentally and he has been about. It's good he's not one of the younger ones. 'He's had highs and lows and he's been there and seen it and represented Rangers terrifically well in his career. 'Hopefully that's it and, although it happened, the overriding feeling for me was that other supporters turned it on its head and that made it better.' The need for Rangers to find some unity at Tynecastle is obvious enough. They must beat champions Hearts and hope Hibs – yet to beat Falkirk this season – show the mental fragility many now regard as their trademark. If Rangers do attain second place, it means two less play-off games. Perhaps more importantly it also avoids another trip to the artificial pitch of Queen of the South where they have already lost 2-0 and 3-0 this season. 'Whoever gets Queen of the South will have a hard game,' said McCall. 'We lost down there twice, but we did beat them once at Ibrox and drew with them, too. 'If we have to go down there, we would be confident because we would have to play them at a full Ibrox as well, which would give everyone a huge lift. 'They have done really well and had two good results against us, but if we play Queen of the South and Hibs - or just Hibs - they will be tough games. 'We've obviously got to win to get second and that's what we'll try to do. Obviously, there is a slight advantage to finishing second with playing two less games. But when it comes down to it, you are just going to have win football games. McCulloch is in line to play for Rangers against league leaders Hearts at the weekend . McCall questioned whether fans booing their own players has any positive impact upon the team . 'If we manage to win at Hearts and Hibs don't win, there will be no great celebrations from our point of view because we won't have achieved anything. 'We've got into the play-offs but, either way, all the hard work is in front of us. 'We're aiming to win on Saturday, we think we can win, but I just really want a good, strong performance to go into the play-offs.'","Captain Lee McCulloch was booed by Rangers supporters last weekend .

9136,ac6ff1d71829303c5a7c8a2239e477c6c1f9a433,"(CNN)Indonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called ""Bali Nine."" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, ""don't judge me too harshly.""  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  ""A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life."" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, ""The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options."" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the ""extensive rehabilitation"" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to ""use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.""","Two Australian drug smugglers, part of the Bali Nine, await word whether they'll face a firing squad .

The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-IT classes. However, research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices. Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim (stock image above) Courtney Blackwell, at Northwestern University in the US, found that, in tests, kindergarten children who shared iPads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no iPads or in which each student had their own device. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users. She worked with 352 students at a Midwestern suburban school district during the research. Miss Blackwell said the findings suggest it’s the ‘collaborative learning around the technology that made the difference, not just the collaboration in and of itself’.

7876,b8803c87ad83ffc194b4161bfcdd6e9584e7d653,"(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for ""lost"" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the ""holiday"" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the ""mistake"" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the ""war on women"" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious ""war on women"" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The ""war on women"" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the ""war on women"" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative ""solution"" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.","Sabrina Schaeffer: Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, a fictitious holiday marked by progressive women .

A conman has been jailed for stealing a pensioner's entire £401,000 life savings and using it to finance his dream wedding and honeymoon. Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the £400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard. Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there. He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited £500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier. Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money. The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend £15,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milk . From there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans. But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon. Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear. In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life. 'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.' Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him. 'The thought of the inevitable custodial sentence has been utterly terrifying,' he said. 'Since his arrest it has been a palpable fear which has affected the quality of his life.' But the judge ignored his plea and jailed him.","Kevin Franklin left his 80-year-old victim without any money to buy milk .

1078,061ea0d20afc4fbab2bac7117e001eef3ecf4a5c,"Audi has created a so-called 'green' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide. The car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the 'fuel of the future' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles. Experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel. Scroll down for video . Audi claims to have created the fuel of the future - diesel (shown above) made from water and carbon dioxide. Experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel . Tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels, or used as a fuel in its own right. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. Reiner Mangold, head of sustainable product development at Audi, said: 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long‑distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate. Audi's fuel was developed with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature. The hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures. This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels, but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude'. Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70%. The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel. 'Using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in Germany, but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries.' The new fuel was developed by Audi along with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam, which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature.

Hydrogen is  pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons, known as 'blue crude'. Hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels . Audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings – known as aromatic hydrocarbons – which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution. A breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power. Currently, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. The approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the  oxidation half of the reaction. Christian von Olshausen, chief technology officer at Sunfire, said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel. He said: 'The engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created.' A special processing plant has been built in Dresden Reick and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months. The carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct. Audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using 'direct air capturing'. Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming. By capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air, Audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere. The project is the latest attempt by Audi to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. The minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car . In 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane – for use in its g-tron gas powered vehicles. At the launch of the new e-diesel, Dr Wanka put five litres of the fuel into her official Audi A8. She said: 'This synthetic diesel, made using carbon dioxide, is a huge success for our sustainability research. 'If we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material, we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources, and put the fundamentals of the ""green economy"" in place.'","German car manufacturer used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into 'blue crude' oil which was then refined into diesel .

The granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has admitted falsely claiming almost £18,000 in benefits. Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit even though she was living in a home owned by her mother and her partner, who was also working. Wilkinson, who was a British Airways cabin crew attendant, was ordered to pay back a total of £17,604 that she claimed over two years when she appeared at South and East Cheshire Magistrates Court last week. She admitted two charges of dishonestly making false representations in order to claim housing benefit, Council Tax benefit and income support. Magistrates sentenced her to 24 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 24 months and ordered her to pay costs of £675 and a victim surcharge of £50. Her grandfather, Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977. He was sacked over his affair with the wife of the team's physio in 1977. Steph Cordon, Cheshire East Council's head of communities, said: 'It is a big mistake for fraudsters to think they can get away with claiming benefits they are not entitled to. 'They risk ending up with a criminal conviction for a serious offence of dishonesty and being ordered to repay the money they have falsely claimed. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards benefit fraud because we are determined to ensure that the benefits system works for people who really need help.' Wilkinson of  Knutsford, applied for housing benefit and Council Tax benefit in April 2011, saying that she was on a low income, was living in a privately-rented property and needed assistance with her rent and council tax, a court heard, . Football star: Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977, pictured here after winning the FA Cup in his final year at the club . She also made a claim for income support to help her and her daughter as she had no other income. Fundraising: A pregnant Amy Wilkinson outside Downing Street in 2011 after she raised £10,000 for charity after the death of her son . However, investigators from Cheshire East Council's benefit fraud investigation team and the Department for Work and Pensions found she had failed to declare that her mother owned the property for which she was claiming housing benefit. They also discovered that Wilkinson's partner had joined her household in January 2012 and had been supporting her and the family financially. Over a two-year period, she received a total of £17,604 in state benefits that she was not entitled to. She will have to repay in full the benefits that she fraudulently obtained. In 2011 she raised more than £10,000 for baby charity Tommy's and was thanked by the Chancellor George Osborne, who is also her local MP. She spent 18 months fundraising after she went into labour at 29 weeks and lost her son, Billy John, who tragically only lived for three minutes. Describing why she raised the money she said at the time: 'I was 29 weeks pregnant when I went into labour but they don't know why, there's just no answer for it. I needed something to focus on. 'Tommy's has been fabulous with us and on their website, they have a forum where you can talk to other people about it.

Among them, strips of brightly-coloured running track, which have been installed in the airport's hallways. While of course passengers are entertained by the latest buzzworthy stunt, we have to wonder: were they really intended to encourage travellers to dash to their boarding gate? Tokyo's Narita Airport has installed running tracks in its new Terminal 3 in honour of the 2020 Olympics . Turns out that the cushioned tracks were actually designed to celebrate the 2020 Olympics, which will be held in Tokyo. But there's no denying that the footpaths are extremely useful regardless. The blue path leads passengers toward departures, while arrivals can be reached by following the red pathway. Further, in each lane there are a series of icons, which include information such as the distance to other terminals, directions to nearby restaurants and shops and where to find outside transport options. The recently-opened terminal will be primarily used for departures and arrivals of low-cost carriers . To save money, the airport installed these cushioned running tracks, which also include directional information . All of the blue lanes lead towards the departure area, while the red track leads travellers to arrivals . The new terminal, which will be used for many of the city's low-cost carrier departures, first opened on April 8 and according to the website, the aim of the innovative tracks was, in part, to save money. 'To cut costs, we opted not to install the typical moving walkways or illuminated signs,' the terminal's website reads. 'Instead, to offer an exciting walking experience that is easy on the feet, we implemented running tracks used for track and field, and added signage for user-friendly guidance.'","In Terminal 3, cushioned running paths direct passengers to their gates .

8814,412fbd69c571e33bc62697987a62f675cad09069,"Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them. The interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick-start their faltering promotion bid. So far, everything is going to plan with Gers second in the Scottish Championship table and destined for a semi-final play-off slot. Stuart McCall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season, though he may not be at Rangers . But with 12 players out of contract, McCall knows the Light Blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals Celtic next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals. He said: 'I've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when... Even if I'm not here, if I'm getting players put to me who would like to come to Rangers regardless of the manager, then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year. 'It's not a case of us standing still and then thinking come June 1, 'Oh we need to get into action'. 'No, there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff, we think will be good for next season, regardless of what league we are in. 'It would be slightly naive [if we were not doing that]. If I'm in charge or not, I still want the club to do well and I will put my view across to the board on who I think should be coming into the club and who should be here.' McCall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position . Rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation. The club's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous Craig Whyte regime and former boss Ally McCoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former Ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad. But McCall revealed the club's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before. 'I think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people,' said the former Motherwell boss. 'I don't think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the Champions League and bringing players in for three and four million yet. 'I don't think Rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere. Rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years . 'But certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place. 'Having said that, I spoke to Craig Levein at Hearts and they do a lot of their scouting with [online service] Wyscout. When I brought Henrik Ojamaa in at Motherwell, that was after I'd seen a clip of him on YouTube. I sold him for £350,000 after signing him for nothing. That was great. 'So you can still do your own background work. Personally I would always like to see the player myself. I've only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it. 'So yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where Rangers are, not to the extent where we have scouts all over Europe.' McCall admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin Gordon Strachan's Scotland staff for the June 13 Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland in Dublin. And he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of Saturday's match with Falkirk. McCall's side are still in line for promotion, sitting in the play-off positions in the Scottish Championship . Peter Houston's Bairns - five points behind fourth-placed Queen of the South with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play-offs but McCall says that raises more questions than answers. He said: 'Housty is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so I don't know what to expect. 'It will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play-offs so I don't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free. 'They don't lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes. We have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best.'","Rangers are currently second in the Scottish Championship .

Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine, while another had traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked, a newspaper investigation revealed. While the venues do let players as young as 18 in, the majority of attendees are elderly, and the discoveries mirror a spike in OAPs being treated for drug abuse. Out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country, seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets, while this one, in Hengrove Leisure Park, Bristol, was found to have traces of crack cocaine . Class A: While bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit, the majority of visitors are pensioners (pictured, Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol, where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets) Figures from Public Health England show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year, a rise of 20 per cent in a year, and double the rates seen in 2009. A probe by The Sun used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country. The news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly, with 634 treated for addiction last year (stock picture) Two Gala Bingo premises in Clydebank Retail Park and Hawthorne Quadrant, Glasgow, tested positive for the drug, while Mecca Bingo in Coral Island, Blackpool, also showed traces of cocaine. Gala Bingo in Basildon and Mecca Bingo in Romford, Essex, also had positive results, as did Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol. Another Bristol venue, Gala Bingo in Hengrove Leisure Park, tested positive for crack cocaine, which is highly addictive. Kate Lawrence, of drug charity Phoenix Futures, told the paper’s Grant Rollings that the findings were unsurprising, adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness, or to socialise. She said: 'We assume older people don't want to go out and socialise, but they do, particularly if they are lonely. Loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs. 'The older generation isn't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs. Representatives from both Mecca Bingo and Gala Bingo said that their companies took a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises. Figures released early last year showed that, as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems, thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit. Busted: Mecca Bingo Blackpool was among the eight premises where traces of Class A drugs were found . Zero tolerance: Both Gala Bingo and Mecca Bingo said drug taking was banned in both of their venues (pictured, Gala Bingo in Basildon, where cocaine traces were discovered) More than 2,000 people in their 60s, 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago. The dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s, and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades. The majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine, although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis, amphetamines and prescription medications.","Out of 17 bingo halls tested, seven revealed traces of cocaine in toilets .

The former premier made an unannounced visit to Ulaanbataar last month in his capacity as a consultant to the cash-strapped government, which is dogged by allegations of endemic corruption. He met new Mongolian prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg but the secrecy surrounding his trip stoked fears from ecologists and the opposition that he is being deployed to encourage Western investment to the country to massively increase gold, copper and coal mining, despite acute environmental worries. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair with a Mongolian dignitary on his recent visit. The former British premier has been dragged into a row over gold mining plans which could destroy the ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors . A silver plate from the Noyon Uul burials, where some of the ancestors of Attila the Hun (right) are buried . An excavation at Noyon Uul. Ecologists fear a mining boom in the region could destroy sacred treasures . Specifically, there is concern over plans for development of the sacred pine-covered Noyon Uul region around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar which has £1.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation, dating back to the first century BC. 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn, citing official sources. The news outlet - which claimed Blair had flown 'secretly' to Mongolia last week - also speculated he was advising on another controversial project, involving expansion of multinational Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert, and a possible bailout from the IMF. Atilla was a feared fifth century barbarian warrior who ruled the Hunnic Empire from the Urals to the Rhine. He was born in modern-day Hungary, but his fearsome forebears are seen as originating much further east, in Mongolia. Activists from ecological pressure groups including Save Noyon Uul have protested to the government that plans for a foreign mining company to exploit gold reserves 'will destroy the historical monuments of the Mongols and their ancestors. 'Driven to despair, they promised that if the Mongolian government allows mining in the sacred land of the Mongols, its defenders are ready to give their lives to save Noyon Uul', said one report last week. Mr Blair's visit to Ulaanbataar was not noted on his website. His office said he makes regular Mongolia trips . Noyon Uul is around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar and has £1.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation dating back to the first century BC . 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn . Silver decorations for a harness recovered from the burial site. It has up to 200 burial mounds . The Mongolian premier - who recruited Blair to Mongolia two years ago when he held the position of cabinet minister - is seen as the leading advocate of the plan to boost mining in several regions, including Noyon Uul, where Canadian company Centerra Gold may be given the go-ahead to exploit significant reserves. He lunched with the former Labour Party leader after he held a 'text message referendum', dismissed as a cheap gimmick by foes, aimed at garnering support for new mining to boost the flagging economy. The country's president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has 'a strong stance against mining of Noyen Uul and wants to leave the cultural heritage site intact', evidently contrary to the position of his prime minister, it was reported. There was no mention of the Mongolian trip on the official website of The Office of Tony Blair, nor any comment from the Ulaanbaatar government on whether his work includes advice on exploiting 50 tons of gold reserves. But Mongolia is under severe pressure to raise revenue from mining to head off an economic crisis after foreign investment slumped 74 per cent last year, with speculation also centering on Tavan Tolgoi, one of the world's largest untapped coal deposits in the South Gobi Desert. Tony Blair Associates one year ago hired Anand Pillai, formerly an adviser to Rio Tinto in Mongolia. Noted Russian scientist Natalia Polosmak - who has made sensational archeological discoveries at Noyon Uul - said: 'This was the burial ground of the Hun elite. Tony Blair takes part in discussions during his visit. He was recruited to work with Mongolia two years ago .

'The collection of fabrics that we found there is unique.' Among the precious finds were elaborate chariots buried with Hun warlords, unique fabrics, ancient jewellery, plaques decorated in silver and gold, and carvings of fantastical creatures. A spokesperson from Mr Blair's office said: 'Tony Blair regularly visits Mongolia as part of his project there - which is already in the public domain - and has a full time team working on helping the government with its reform programme. 'He has nothing whatever to do with any gold mining business or other mining there so we don't know what is being referred to.' A spokesman for Centerra Gold, referring to the company's Gatsuurt mine in the Noyon Uul region, said: 'Our Gatsuurt property has been designated as a deposit of strategic importance. 'We are continuing to work with the government to determine the level of Mongolian ownership in the project and before Gatsuurt can proceed. We need a deposit development agreement and the necessary permits, approvals and regulatory commissioning.

The Whole Damn Farm, which costs £13.50, is the creation of Sam Longhurst, head chef of Splendid Kitchen, Manchester. He devised the mega meal - which contains two beef patties and a whole fried chicken thigh - after he was challenged by diners to create a burger containing three kinds of meat. The Whole Damn Farm burger features two beef burgers, homemade bacon jam, ham chunks, a whole chicken thigh, barbequed pulled pork and bacon rashers . Ready, get set, go! Customer Angela Fox gets ready to take on the mighty meat challenge . The monstrous meat feast has two beef burgers weighing 220g, a layer of homemade bacon jam, 100g of ham chunks and a 150g whole battered and fried chicken thigh. Added to that is 80g of barbequed pulled pork and four rashers of bacon all sandwiched between two brioche buns. With a meat equivalent of six Big Macs the burger was created after a customer presented with the restaurant's 'Cow & Chicken' burger - a feast in its own right - remarked, 'It's almost the whole damn farm.' Mr Longhurst said: 'We are always up for a challenge and when a customer seemed disappointed by a burger that only contained beef and chicken, we knew we had to take it one step further. 'You could say we've taken it several steps further as there are six different forms of meat on there. I think it'll keep the punters satisfied.'

'He kept looking at me and there was nothing I could do.' Not a habit: Ms Hannant said it was the first time Cody had escaped from his field in six months of living there . Almost there: Cody was glad when he could finally touch down on dry land again. He was taken to his stables to see a vet who gave him painkillers, vitamin injections and a booster . Ms Hannant feared the firefighters would accidentally break Cody's leg or the 15-hand horse would panic and colic (stomach cramps), which is potentially fatal. The mum-of-three, who also has a baby grandchild, praised London Fire Brigade saying: 'They were all trying to keep him calm. 'They were talking about getting a crane at one point.' It took crews an hour-and-a-half to rescue Cody, who was lifted from the water by a device under his stomach. Ms Hannant said: 'No one could believe he was a white horse. 'When he got out he looked like Black Beauty.' It was the first time Cody escaped from his field in six months of living there. She thinks her water-loving horse broke out through a hole in the fence and jumped in for a swim, not realising he would get stuck. Horsing around: There was even talk of a crane having to be used at one point but rescuers eventually freed the Havana cob. His owner, Tracey Hannant, believed the horse had probably gone for a swim to cool off . Back at home: Cody's owner Tracey Hannant spoke of the moment he was rescued. She said: 'No one could believe he was a white horse. When he got out he looked like Black Beauty.' Her son Tyler, 13, with the horse . On dry land: Cody is enjoying being back home in his field with Tyler, who was out riding the horse again following the animal's rescue from a ditch in Anderson Way in Belvedere, south London on Friday last week . She spent all day Monday building a new electric fence to keep Cody and her other four horses safe. Ms Hannant added: 'Cody is not just a horse, I have brought him up since he was six-months-old. 'I felt so helpless. That was the worst pain I have ever known in my life.'

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .","Sofia Davila, 21, nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook' over crimes .

10967,9d1d5e52f9f4e75519a8976066556563c7c74568,"A Chicago single mother has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement. Adriana Alvarez, 22, says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having worked for McDonald's for five years. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees of the fast food chain began to protest. Scroll down for video . Single mother Adriana Alvarez, 22, has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement in Chicago . Alvarez (pictured with her three-year-old son Manny) says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having word for McDonald's for five years . The mother revealed in a column for Refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a 'decent place to live' with good schools for her three-year-old son Manny. 'When it rains, water steeps into the apartment,' Alvarez writes of her basement home, the only place she said she can afford. 'This wetness brings mold, and I can't get rid of the smell. We can’t even leave anything on the floor... toys or anything else on the floor may get ruined when the water comes in.' Alvarez said that, after paying for 'child care, transportation to work, food, rent, and our other basic expenses,' she can never afford to give anything else to her son. 'Every time I think about taking Manny somewhere fun, like to a movie, I have to think about whether we can really afford the gas,' she writes. The mother said even providing the specific milk her son, who drinks 'a half-gallon every two days', requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle. Since it's a more expensive brand, it uses up most of the $80 Alvarez is allotted in food stamps, she told the New York Times. Alvarez said her situation is not unique. She said that most of her co-workers are 'in the same boat', forced to rely on government assistance 'no matter how long they've held their jobs'. According to one study cited in Business Insider, half of the nation's fast food workers require some kind of government assistance, costing taxpayers $7billion a year. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting . Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage . And $1.2billion of that public assistance goes to employees of McDonald's annually, reported a study released by the National Employment Law Project. Just weeks ago, McDonald's announced that it would be giving a $1 pay raise for about 90,000 employees, effectively making their wage $10 an hour. But the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation. Restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were ineligible for the wage bump, which Alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 McDonald's employees. And, even for those who do get an increased wage, Alvarez argues that the number would 'hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty'. And higher wages aren't all Alvarez and her co-workers are fighting for. She said Fight For $15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union 'without interference from management'. A group of protesters in New York stage a die-in as part of a day of rallies and protests by fast-food workers known as 'Fight for $15 on April 15' Fight For $15 (pictured protesting on Wednesday) started two years ago in New York, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving . Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. The movement staged rallies across the country yesterday in honor of 'Fight for $15 on April 15'. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand a wage raise. There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change. But Alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon. 'It doesn't seem right that people who work with children or who serve food aren't paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table,' she writes. 'We want our families to be able to look forward to a better future.' There has been some change.

8933,a67939e6939b1cb731d804068f39444289444433,"(CNN)Wednesday's game between the Baltimore Orioles and Chicago White Sox will be closed to the public, the Orioles announced Tuesday. The closed-door contest follows the postponements of Monday's and Tuesday's games against the White Sox until a doubleheader scheduled for May 28 following unrest in Baltimore. A source within Major League Baseball told CNN the league is not aware of any prior closed-door games in major league history. The game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards is scheduled to begin at 2:05 p.m. ET. The game will be televised on the MASN regional cable network. ""After conferring with local officials, it was determined that Wednesday afternoon's game should be played without fan admittance in order to minimize safety concerns,"" Major League Baseball said. The office of new Commissioner Rob Manfred said the league and Orioles will keep an eye on the situation in Baltimore. ""Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by violence in Baltimore, and everyone in our game hopes for peace and the safety of a great American city,"" Manfred said. Hall of Famer Frank Thomas tweeted that the series should be moved to a later date. The former White Sox star said, ""Playing in front of a empty house makes no sense!!"" The game changes come as the situation in the city remains tense following Monday's riots, with more protests and arrests Tuesday. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said the closed game will mean ""another sad day in our city."" ""We're a sports town. We love our O's,"" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The Orioles said tickets from Monday's postponed game can be used for admittance on May 28. Fans with tickets for Tuesday's game must exchange them for tickets for any remaining home game, including May 28. The team also announced it would move three games (May 1-3) against the Tampa Bay Rays to Florida. The Orioles will still be the home team, the team said. Fans with tickets for those games and Wednesday's contest can swap their tickets for future games, based on the dollar amount of the ticket. Exchanges must be completed by June 30, the team said. The Orioles have averaged more than 33,000 fans in their first nine games at Camden Yards this season, about 73% of capacity. According to MLB.com, games have been postponed in the past because of security concerns. In 1992, four Los Angeles Dodgers games were pushed back because of riots after the acquittals of police officers in the Rodney King case. In 1967, riots in Detroit prompted baseball officials to move games between the Tigers and the Orioles to Baltimore. Opening Day of 1968 was postponed for two days after the killing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, all professional baseball was called off for one week. ESPN anchor and baseball expert Keith Olbermann tweeted that a September 1882 game hosted by Worcester had six fans come, the lowest spectator turnout for a major league game.

101,4a9172eee3b65bbf2e3309b7b785d76fa6d8eb24,"Thousands of holidaymakers face up to three days of chaos and cancelled flights because of a strike by French air traffic controllers. EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers. 'Ryanair said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options - full refund, free transfer onto next available flight or free transfer onto an alternative flight routing.'","Strike is set to begin at 5am tomorrow and continue for two days .

We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.","Dutch and Canadian study looked at 100 men and women .

3529,65cafde01954d1cb410deb9f6e9f9a724fd59fc1,"A rare insight into Manchester United's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club. The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening £800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . • Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . • The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . • Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . • The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . • Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . • The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres – on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'.

And research shows that if your tip is seventh down the list or the jockey's racing colours are Royal blue, emerald green or red, then you're more likely to return to the bookies and collect a few bob. The world's greatest steeplechase takes place on Saturday at Aintree, which will be watched by a worldwide audience of 600 million with an estimated £500 million being staked globally by punters. Scroll down for video . Four out of ten Britons betting on the Grand National won last year by Pineau De Re, centre, make their choice purely down to the name of the horse while 70 per cent of women admit relying on pot luck . Jockey Sam Twiston Davies, pictured, admitted that he always salutes a magpie on his way to Aintree . Out of 2,000 Britons who confirmed they would be having a bet, 40 per cent of them admitted their selection would be purely down to the name of the horse because it would have struck a chord. A surprising 60 per cent said their secret superstition was to have the same family members gathered around the TV watching the race every year. Others revealed they sit in the same chair and have exactly the same food and drink during the race every time – and even wear the same 'lucky' clothes! When it comes to the big day, the survey – by National sponsors Crabbie's Alcoholic Ginger Beer – showed that a huge 70 per cent of women simply rely on pure chance opposed to 47-per cent of men who try to study form. But, to the bookies' glee, less than 20 per cent of those quizzed said their quirky superstitions actually produced a win. Survey boss Al Cross said: 'It seems most people have some sort of good luck charm. My own ritual is to always pick the well turned-out horse. It's worked for me twice, but I will keep trying.' And leading jump jockey Sam Twiston-Davies added: 'I only have one race ritual, and that is always to salute a magpie!'

He played under Louis van Gaal in Brazil and will face his former international boss when Villa travel to Old Trafford on Saturday. The 30-year-old is out of contract in the summer and, having shaken off a calf injury, Villa boss Sherwood wants Vlaar to rediscover his spark. He said: 'We all know what he has done over the years but when people are putting their hands in their pockets to fork out money, they want to know they are getting value. 'He was right up there with the best at the World Cup but people have short memories. 'You are always looking at what people are doing now rather than a few months ago. 'He will have far more options open to him if he is in the shop window that's for sure.' Vlaar has only made 12 Barclays Premier League starts this season following calf and knee problems as Villa, three points above the relegation zone, battle the drop. His last game in February saw him concede a stoppage-time penalty and get sent off as Villa lost 2-1 to Stoke in Sherwood's first match. And Sherwood has put any contract talks on hold with Vlaar in order to focus on keeping Villa in the top flight. 'He realises he needs to be playing. I haven't even bothered speaking to him. There's time for that when we are safe,' he said. 'He is just concentrating on getting fit to play. Without getting on the pitch, he's not going to be an attractive proposition to anybody.'

We had people here from France, Russia and Canada - they joined in because they could see our pain,’ event organiser Jan Kerr said. ‘It was magic to see.’ Orange resident Mark Andrew, who travelled to Canowindra on Sunday to pay his respects to the murdered teacher said it was a beautiful opportunity to honour Ms Scott. 'It was a surreal start to a sad and poignant day,' Mr Andrew told Daily Mail Australia. 'The only sounds were those of the burners on the balloons as they prepared to take off. The moment of take off was quite profoundly emotional. 'The silent gathering was akin to that at the ANZAC dawn service which is topical.' Scroll down for video . More than a dozen hot-air balloons took to the skies in Stephanie Scott's hometown Canowindra on Sunday morning . The town paid tribute to the much-loved teacher by filling the sky with brightly coloured hot-air balloons and smaller yellow balloons . The latest tribute comes just one week after Ms Scott was murdered and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to walk down the aisle to marry her partner of five years. Family and friends of the pair had flown from around the world to attend their big day, but are now bracing themselves to attend her funeral. Efforts to find out exactly what happened to Stephanie are continuing with forensic specialists expected to carry out a post-mortem on the body on Monday. The burned remains were found by police just five metres from a road in the Cocoparra National Park in the NSW Riverina region at about 5pm on Friday.

NSW police are reportedly expected to make inquiries with their counterparts in the Netherlands as part of their investigation into Stephanie's death.

Build-time pressure over the winter resulted in the Silverstone-based marque starting the campaign with a car that is considerably off the pace. The additional knock-on effect means a delay in the introduction of the team's B-spec model, which is now not due to be unveiled until the Austrian Grand Prix in June. Sergio Perez walks through the paddock in Shanghai ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Perez locks his brakes on his way to 10th place finish in the Australian Grand Prix in March . The hope is Perez and team-mate Nico Hulkenberg will then finally be able to compete for points finishes, rather than crossing fingers a top-10 spot comes their way via reliability issues for their rivals. If performance is lacking, however, Perez fears the worst. 'We're hoping to make a big step forward,' said Perez. 'If we make that step then we can still have a good year as there will be plenty of races remaining, a lot of time to recover. 'But if we don't make the step we're hoping for then it's going to be a very painful year.' For the team and the Mexican, who was 10th in the season-opening race in Australia - where only 15 started and 11 finished - and 13th in Malaysia recently, the current struggles are already tough to endure. Perez fears for Force India's pace and was hounded by the equally troubled McLaren duo of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in the Malaysia Grand Prix near the back of the grid . Perez finished 13th at Sepang and admits Force India are relying on their June upgrade to come good . 'It is frustrating knowing we don't have a competitive car that can take us into the points on pure pace. It's really hard,' Perez added. 'It is also really hard to keep motivated. Going into a race, knowing it is going to be very hard without any advantage, is not the easiest for a driver. 'At the moment, on pure pace, it is quite difficult to make it into the points. We're quite far from the teams ahead of us. 'We are in a position where it's very easy to make mistakes, to lose the car as it is very difficult with degradation and stuff. 'From now on we are going to have hard races, but it is what it is at the moment. We have to be professional and do the job as if we are going to win the race.

The 21-year-old has begun the last day of the hallowed tournament after setting a scoring record for 54 holes of 16 under par. He is playing alongside British contender Justin Rose in the final, showcase pairing, and will be looking to avoid the disappointment of last year, when he finished runner-up. Some of his American rivals, such as Tiger Woods, have slipped down the leaderboard. But others, including Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are still posing a threat. Jordan Speith, pictured during his final round on Sunday, is in prime position to win The Masters, taking a four shot lead into the final round at Augusta . He is playing with British contender Justin Rose, who began the day four shots off the pace . Spieth, who squandered a front-nine Masters lead on Sunday last year and settled for sharing second behind Bubba Watson, is the man to beat for the top prize of $1.8 million at the $10 million event. 'Last year definitely left a bad taste in my mouth,' Spieth said. 'Looking at trying to get some revenge. I've got a long way to go still.' The spotlight belonged to Spieth, who could break Tiger Woods' 1997 tournament record of 18-under 270 by shooting 69 in the final round. The former world number one Woods started the day some shots back, and caused concern on the 7th hole when he seemed to injure his finger. He then pulled up on the 8th tee, shaking off the same hand while his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watched from the crowds. If he wins, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in Masters history, five months older than Woods when he won his first major in 1997. Spieth could also become only the fifth wire-to-wire winner in Masters history, joining Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Jack Nicklaus in 1972 and Ray Floyud in 1976. Spieth is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds, but Norman squandered a six-stroke lead in making the greatest last-day collapse in major golf history and lost by five to Nick Faldo. Tiger Woods  waits to play a shot on the first hole during the final round. He started the day further down the field looking to make up lost ground .

His girlfriend, gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn, was spotted walking up the first way as he got his round underway . She has been on hand to support her beau at Augusta throughout the week . No player in Masters history has ever reached 19-under at any stage of the tournament but Spieth flirted with it Saturday, making four birdies in five holes to stand 18-under before a double bogey at 17 and a 10-foot par save at 18, and could threaten again Sunday. With 22 birdies through 54 holes, Spieth broke Woods' record of 21 in 2005 and is on pace to shatter Mickelson's Masters 72-hole birdie total record of 25 from 2001. But Spieth has not made the Masters a runaway. Rose, who closed with five birdies in the last six holes Saturday, is trying for a second major crown - 22 months after his breakthrough at Merion. And Mickelson is still in position to potentially become the second-oldest winner in Masters history after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won in 1986. Mickelson has only one top-10 in his past 31 starts but it was a runner-up effort at last year's PGA Championship. Mickelson won the 2004, 2006 and 2010 Masters, as well as the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 British Open. Should he win Sunday, he would match Faldo and Lee Trevino as six-time major champions. Spieth (above with girlfriend Annie Verret on her 21st birthday) is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds . On Saturday it was reported that the Dallas, Texas native has just bought $2.3million on a stunning Texas mansion and has a gorgeous girlfriend, Annie Verret, who also happens to be his high school sweetheart. Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Steven, Spieth's younger brother, is an athlete as well, and plays basketball for Brown University. Then there is his youngest sibling Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum, and who has played the biggest role in shaping her brother's career according to Spieth's mother. She says Ellie helps the young superstar stay so grounded. 'Jordan wouldn't be where he's at today if he didn't grow up with Ellie,' said Mrs. Spieth in an interview with ESPN. 'Jordan realizes this isn't real life at the Masters. Trying to sit around and have dinner when his sister doesn't want to eat when everybody else is eating and has a fit, that's real life.'

The victims were lured to Britain but were 'treated like dogs' - being made to urinate in buckets and live and eat outside in winter, prosecutors say. The jury heard how the workers were kept under duress amid fears for the safety of their families back home and sent to work in dog food factories, food plants and car washes in Plymouth, Devon. But they were made to give over all their wages, forced to eat outside during the winter and do housework to pay off 'loans' for their board and passage, a jury heard. Accused: Petr Tancos (left) and sister Ruzena Tancosova (right) are on trial for people trafficking in Plymouth . The allegations of their shocking treatment were made during a trial of five family members at Plymouth Crown Court. Ruzena Tancosova, 34, brother Petr Tancos, 35, cousin Martin Tancos, 35, Nela Dzurkova, 26, and Katerina Kurejova, 35, all of Plymouth, are charged with people trafficking. All deny the charges. Police say victims would be threatened with violence by the gang who pocketed their wages and benefits - believed to be around £150,000 - and even made them shoplift. Malcolm Galloway, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the five defendants, all members of an extended Czech Roma family, brought the immigrants over. He said a neighbour also saw one standing by and directing one of the men to cut grass with a kitchen knife. He said: 'These defendants entered into a criminal agreement to traffick other Czech nationals into the UK and then exploit them for financial benefit.' Mr Galloway said: 'They (the immigrants) came with a promise of good pay, a job and a future.' Mr Galloway said the family used various methods to exploit the men - including for example putting a notice on the toilet door charging £1 for its use. But the court heard that the men were also threatened with violence if they failed to comply. He said: 'They would put them up in their houses in Plymouth. The Czech nationals would sometimes have to sleep on the floor, outside in the garage. 'They would have to urinate in buckets and eat outside.' He added that police started surveillance after two immigrants went to the authorities. Officers then searched their properties on September 16 last year. The court heard one man, Josef Bukovinsky, told police he had been 'living with the gypsies' in the Czech Republic before he was 'sold to Ruzena' (Tancosova). On trial: Nela Dzurkova (left) and Katerina Kurejova (right) are part of a Roma family accused of illegally trafficking Czech migrants into the UK and 'treating them like dogs' Mr Galloway said he was one of 11 men who lived with Tancosova in less than three years at a former address in Plymouth. All five defendants are charged with conspiracy to traffic individuals into the country for the purpose of exploitation between April 6, 2013, and September 16, 2014. Tancosova, Petr Tancos and Dzurkova are also charged with the same offence again but applying to an earlier period between January 1, 2010, and April 5, 2013. Tancosova and Martin Tancos are further accused of acting as gangmasters in supplying workers to pack agricultural products. Tancosova and Petr Tancos also allegedly required a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2014. Mr Galloway told the trial that Tancos was seen by neighbours at different addresses to supervise the immigrants. He said a neighbour of Tancos and partner and co-defendant Nela Dzurkova spotted three men apparently living in their garage. The woman told police she saw Dzurkova passing food out of the kitchen window to men who stood in the garden of the house eating from trays in winter. He said: 'She also saw Petr Tancos standing by and directing one of the men to cut the grass with a kitchen knife.' He said the man was on his hands and knees. Mr Galloway said the neighbour noticed that Petr Tancos encouraged his children to throw stones at the men. She estimated that between 10 and 12 men lived at the home at different times. Mr Galloway said another immigrant, Miroslav Ritter, stayed with Petr Tancos and Dzurkova at their last address. He added: 'He slept, in his words, like a dog under the window in the living room, in a gap between the table and window. 'He slept on the carpet with a blanket and a pillow.' Jan Banyak told police he stayed at the home of Martin Tancos and Kurejova and £600 a month in rent to sleep on the kitchen floor. Mr Banyak believed that he earned about £250 a week working in a factory, but he did not know where the money went. He only received about £10 from Martin Tancos. Mr Galloway said: 'He told the police they usually had to eat outside. There were 10 of them and Katerina Kurejova did not want them inside as there were only two rooms. They eat mostly tinned food.' He added that when police raided the address, they found two other men sleeping on mattresses, under the stairs and in the kitchen. Mr Galloway said Tancosova, who had four bank accounts, pocketed £86,517 in benefits over four years and eight months. He added: 'The credit turnover for the accounts, including benefit payments, amounted to £148,923.' Mr Galloway said police had not been able to trace everyone they suspected of staying at the rented homes of the family. The trial continues.

The 21-year-old shared a photo on Instagram of her soaking up the sun with two friends and captioned the image 'Country music is the best music #tortuga.' In recent weeks, Robson has been stepping up her attempts at getting back on the tennis court after a lengthy absence. Laura Robson (centre) shared a picture on Instagram of her at Tortuga festival with two friends . Robson's last appearance came in the 2014 Australian Open first round where she lost in straight sets . Robson (left) had to wear a protective cast last year but tweeted a picture back on the court last month . Her last appearance was over a year ago, in the first round of the 2014 Australian Open, where she was swept aside in straight sets by Kirtsen Flipkens and she has not played since due to a left wrist problem. She had tendon surgery  and is now nearing a return, although she withdrew from a qualifying event for the Miami Open last month and also removed her name from a WTA Tour event in Bogota later in April. It appears her next target with be the French Open, with the first round starting on Sunday, May 24. Should she make it out on the clay at Roland Garros, it will end a 16-month absence from the court that has left one of Britain's brightest hopes in women's tennis without a world ranking. She has been practising in the United States, in Tampa, as she aims to build up form and fitness. A previous Instagram post on March 26, of her doing a handstand on a tennis court to show off her new shoes, showed supporters she was back training and the strength in her wrist was returning. Her manager, Max Eisenbud, gave an update on her progress at the end of March and sounded cautiously optimistic about how Robson is improving. Robson is now said to be nearing a return and is  targeting the French Open in May . The 21-year-old Robson also missed out on Wimbledon last year but could be in line to play in 2015 . 'I’m happy with the way it’s been going and she’s been hitting the ball great in practice,' Eisenbud said. 'It’s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. 'It’s all about when she is ready to compete. We don’t want to put her in a situation where she can’t play a full tournament.'","Laura Robson has not played since January 2014 due to a wrist problem .

7990,f60570b57867a61c087114a4cc9a3859175ed2eb,"Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . A generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long-term unemployment because of poor technology skills, it is claimed. Experts said training was ‘heavily geared’ towards young people, meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace. This left them vulnerable when companies start ‘shedding’ jobs. While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could ‘go stale’ with age, a study warned. The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) said research showed that over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 – and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s. The AAT said the death of a ‘job for life’ meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Instead, older workers could not become complacent and must constantly ‘reskill’ and retrain to boost their job security, it said. In a new report on the value of training for older workers, it said: ‘The old model of training in youth and a ""career for life"" thereafter no longer applies’. A survey by the AAT found that, while people in their twenties, thirties and forties aspired to take a master’s degree in the future or a vocational qualification, this stopped at 55, when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification. A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification. The majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job, while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer. But the AAT said the reality was they may have a ‘lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks’. Education: A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification . Mark Farrar, of the AAT, said: ‘Older generations are faced with the greatest barriers when it comes to reskilling. ‘Given rapid economic and technological changes, many traditional jobs are less secure than in the past and older workers are increasingly facing the threat of redundancy. ‘The UK’s ageing population is growing and the increased retirement age means people are working for longer. ‘The challenge is therefore to ensure people can continue to participate in the labour market at the later stage of their working lives.’ According to the Office for National Statistics, workers aged 55 and over are less likely to be unemployed than younger workers. But older unemployed people are more likely to have been out of work for 12 months or longer, suggesting they find it harder to find a new job if they do find themselves out of work. The accountancy body said older men were particularly vulnerable to job losses in the declining mining, agriculture and manufacturing industries, while women were heavily over-represented in the public sector so could face risks from cuts to civil servants.","Experts say older workers are left behind in workplace because of training .

As United kicked off their Premier League season with a match against  Swansea in August, Young received a surprise delivery from a bird mid-match, much to the amusement of his team-mates, who took advantage of the situation. Speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine, Shaw said: 'Ashley Young is the joker in the dressing room. We still laugh about the time he got bird poo in his mouth against Swansea. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw (second left) trains at the club's Aon Complex on Friday . Shaw admits that Ashley Young is the biggest joker in the Manchester United dressing room . He says the players still laugh at the time Young got bird poo in his mouth during a match against Swansea . 'If you ask him now, he'll say it wasn't bird poo. In the changing room we hung a fake bird above his place as a joke which he didn't like.' Shaw's revelations come as he nears the end of his first season at Old Trafford. His transition from Southampton star to £31.5million United man has been more difficult than he would have liked, with the left back making just 17 appearances this season. He has suffered a number of injuries, limiting his time on the pitch, but still appears to have settled into his new surroundings well. He admits he picks up tips from goalkeeper David de Gea, who has been in impressive form on the pitch for Louis van Gaal's side. According to Shaw, he is not just a top goalkeeper, but is approachable off the pitch when players need advice too. According to Shaw, United goalkeeper David de Gea is the 'nicest guy in football' and is always approachable . Louis van Gaal's stern demeanour is not limited to the touchline; at training he is equally as focused . Shaw has struggled with a number of injuries since arriving at Manchester United from Southampton . 'David de Gea is funny, he’s kind, if you want to talk to him you can talk to him – he’s the nicest guy in football! 'He’s been unbelievable for us this season and kept us in so many games, he’s starting to become the best goalkeeper in the world.” 'We’ve got a few Spanish-speaking players and they’re always playing their music and dancing around – the English lads hate it. Sometimes we can’t understand them, they say stuff to us and we’re like ‘What?’” After a disappointing campaign under David Moyes last season, Shaw's arrival coincided with that of Van Gaal, who has turned things around at Old Trafford. Now, United look certain to be heading towards a top-four finish, and Shaw admits that Van Gaal's pitch-side focus isn't limited to match-days; at training he is just as stern. 'The manager is always focused on his job, and his job is to win games. I haven’t seen a cheeky side to him yet, but you could say he has one. 'When we’re on the training pitch it’s like a game day, 100 per cent focus, nothing will change his mind or his focus, he’s always on the ball.'

Wet and cloudy weather was to blame in Sydney, where the Sydney Observatory said the short lunar began at 10.58pm (AEDT) and finished at 11.03pm. 'Our live feed from Griffith Observatory is showing gorgeous totality pink!' observatory staff wrote on Twitter at about 11pm, accompanying their tweet with a picture of equipment showing off the bright pink moon. Scroll down for video . The lunar eclipse as seen from Melbourne on Easter Saturday, April 4. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon is completely in the Earth's shadow . Wet and cloudy weather was to blame for Sydneysiders missing out on the view, but the Sydney Observatory captured every moment with their equipment . Brisbane was also predicted to miss out due to bad weather, but the moon was pictured revealing itself through rain clouds towards the end of a total lunar eclipse . The beginning of the eclipse was captured from behind leaves illuminated by a street light in Canberra on Saturday . 'It's highly likely that it will still be cloudy,' The Bureau of Meteorology's Chris Webb had said of Sydney, adding that a break in the clouds at precisely the right moment could still present a slim chance for hopeful sky gazers. Brisbane, Darwin, Canberra and Hobart residents were also promised slim chance of viewing the phenomenon due to poor weather conditions, but clear night skies were predicted for Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth. Those faced with bad weather may not have missed out on much however, with the event being one of the shortest lunar eclipses of the century. 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592,' Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith told the ABC earlier. Despite rain and clouds predicted to obscure the event for Canberrians, this image was taken of the full moon behind clouds on Saturday night .

Residents of Auckland in New Zealand also had a spectacular view of the 'blood moon' A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the edge of the earth's shadow. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. Part of the lunar eclipse is seen behind fully bloomed cherry blossoms in Utsunomiya in Tochigi prefecture, 100km north of Tokyo on April 4 .

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its 'blood red' appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. Simon Allen, BOM's senior meteorologist, told the ABC that Adelaide would have the clearest skies out of all the states - where the partial eclipse began at 8.45pm and the peak at 10:30pm. In Brisbane, cloudy conditions and showers were forecast, denting the chances of seeing the eclipse. There was no rain in Melbourne, where an uninterrupted view of the lunar event began at 9:15pm and peaked at 11pm. Less positive wass the forecast for Hobart, which was for clouds and a 20 per cent chance of rain. The same was also expected in Canberra and a late storm was due in Darwin, however the former managed to clear up enough for some to see the lunar show. Those who miss out will have to wait until January 31, 2018, for the next lunar eclipse visible from Australia. As did the Echo Park district of Los Angeles.

But now, nearly eight months after his passing, the young Oklahoma family has been reunited in their first ever family portrait, thanks to some clever photoshopping by a local photographer. Kayli Henley was snapping pictures of six-month-old Taos and his 20-year-old mother, Sierra Sharry, when the young mom asked the photographer if she could make their family complete. So Henley took a photograph of Smith from the family and, with a ghostly filter, fitted the image around his girlfriend and son, as if he were standing over them. Scroll down for video . Family portrait: A photoshopped image shows Sierra Sharry holding her six-month-old son Taos with her boyfriend, the baby's father, Lane Smith, standing behind them. Smith passed away before his son's birth . Sharry called the ghostly final picture 'amazing'. 'Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what,' she told KOCO. After sharing the image to her Facebook page, the photographer found that other people thought the image was amazing too. It has been liked more than 200,000 times and shared more than 25,000 times, and Henley has been inundated with requests to create other pictures for families who have lost a loved one. In a post shared on the Facebook page, Sharry explained that in July 2014, she and 26-year-old Smith had been nervous about the impending birth of their son. 'We were scared as any new parents would be but ready for the adventure together,' she said. Excitement: 26-year-old Lane Smith, pictured with his girlfriend in the couple's pregnancy announcement, died after hitting his head in an accident in July 2014. His son was born just a few weeks later . When she was around eight months pregnant, they went to jet boat races in El Reno, she recalled. But the weather was too warm for Sharry, so she left her boyfriend there with his family. 'When I left Lane that day I had no clue it would be the last time I'd see him,' she wrote. But in the early hours of the next day, she awoke to a call that Smith had been rushed to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City after he had fallen and hit his head. She and her mother raced to his side. They never considered his injuries could be life-threatening, but once they got there, they were given 'absolutely no hope that Lane was going to make it'. 'July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life,' she explained. 'I lost my best friend. The father of my unborn child. And since that day I have felt so empty inside. A part of me will forever be missing. I loved that man more than life itself.' Strong: Sharry said that part of her has been missing since the death of Taos' father but that the photograph allowed her to see her complete family for the first time. She is pictured in another image from the shoot . Missed: She said she knows that Smith, pictured left, will always be watching over her and their son, right . Their son was born just a few weeks later and when he approached six months, Sharry asked Henley, who is baked in Yukon, if she'd be able to put together a family photo. 'I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it,' Sharry explained to KOCO. So Rene created the photo that has since been shared thousands of times online. 'It brought me to tears,' Sharry wrote about the photograph. 'This is how I picture us. Taos and I living our lives the best we can with Lane ALWAYS watching over our shoulder.' Rene said she was happy to be able to help. 'As soon as I met Taos, he had a smile that was so contagious, the happiest baby boy, and he instantly captured my heart,' she said on her Facebook page. '[I] never knew if I could make this reality for them. So glad I could and they can cherish this forever.'","Lane Smith died after falling and hitting his head in July 2014 - just a few weeks before his girlfriend, Sierra Sharry, gave birth to their son, Taos .

So much so that battle plans would be drawn up to specifically give the castle at Zhangjiakou, in China's northern Hebei province, a wide berth. Now archaeologists have begun a daunting project to restore the once-mighty site to something approaching it previous glory, in particular the dilapidated outer wall that repelled every attack which invading Mongolian armies could throw at it. Among the works being carried out at Wanquan Castle is the restoration of the fortress' dilapidated outer wall . Workers restore the southern barbican entrance to Wanquan Castle, which was known as the Ming Dynasty's 'Martial City' The fortress was built in 1393 and managed to repel all attacks by the invading Mongolian armies . The fortress measures some two kilometres in circumference and was protected by an imposing 12-metre wall . The restoration of the fortress - which was given the coveted title of 'Wucheng' or 'Martial City' after its construction in 1393 - will see building work completed in the original Ming Dynasty style of architecture, reports People's Daily Online. The project will see the restoration of the Ming and Qing era commercial districts, the Great Wall Martial Museum, the Golden Harvest Academy and performance theatres as well as the opening of the Red Tourist Route, with all work planned to be complete in 2016. The restoration work will also include the ongoing protection of surviving structures. The castle in Wanquan county - known in China as a 'living fossil of the Ming military system' - was built in 1393 but is relatively well-preserved, especially the interior city area which includes the residences of generals and wealthy merchants. The fortress has huge historical, cultural and military significance and has key cultural relic status in China. While much of the interior city is in good condition, the outer wall is somewhat dilapidated and will be the focus of much of the work . The restoration work, which is due to be completed next year, will where possible be carried out in the style of Ming Dynasty architecture . The Ming Dynasty ruled China for 276 years, between the years 1368 and 1644, and is often described as the last of the great Chinese dynasties. During the era large scale architectural and civil engineering projects were created or expanded, including the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal and the Forbidden City, located in Beijing. It took 15 years to build, using more than one million workers, and has almost 1,000 buildings. Art flourished during the Ming Dynasty, which saw an explosion of literature, painting, poetry, music and porcelain - with Ming vases and plates valuable collector items to this day. Following popular uprising and rebellions across China, the Chinese army was defeated and the Ming Dynasty collapsed when its last emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City, in 1644.

Robert Charles Bates shot and killed Eric Courtney Harris as the younger man was trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a dollar store. Harris, 44, was being restrained by one of the undercover police officers when Bates, who was monitoring from afar, ran up 'trying to get the situation under control' and fired one shot. According to police at the scene in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bates, a former full-time officer, accidentally pulled out his service weapon instead of the stun gun. Confusion: Robert Charles Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot a man dead, it has been claimed . Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control, inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. He also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition and ran when deputies tried to arrest him, then fought with another deputy when he was shot. Killed: Eric Harris, 44, was allegedly meeting with undercover deputies to buy a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol . He was gunned down after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area ... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' CNN reported. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons.

The Miami-Dade Police Department set up a hidden camera to deal with the ongoing problem of luggage theft, and found workers rifling through checked bags both before they were loaded onto planes and once inside the aircraft's belly. This as it is revealed that airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014. Scroll down for video . Police also caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport (above) stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera . A baggage handler (above) at JFK Airport in New York was also caught on camera going through a passenger's wallet . CNN reports that 31 employees have been arrested for theft in Miami since 2012, including six this year. Incidents of theft at that airport are far less however that New York's John F. Kennedy, which has more claims of lost property that anywhere else in the country. In 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera at that airport, and found workers stealing cash, jewelry, iPhones and iPads, which led to six arrests. Across the country in Los Angeles, 16 airport workers were fired last year after police obtained search warrants for their homes following a increase in reported thefts at the terminal where they were employed. 'We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,' said Patrick Gannon, the police chief at that airport. Overall, there have been 30,621 claims of missing valuables since 2010, with most of these coming from checked luggage. Of those claims, 2,493 occurred at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 (above a JFK employee) Most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal, with only Orlando and Miami screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only Miami screening them when they leave. Since 2002, the TSA has fired 513 workers for theft, though it is now known how many of them faced criminal charges. Gannon believes that theft is not the only problem either, as it could lead to bigger threats in the nation's airports. 'I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism.'","Police caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera .

The waitress told the New Zealand Herald that she published the details of John Key's behaviour, which she experienced while she was working at a cafe in Auckland, as she 'expected more from him' and wanted 'the public to be aware'. The 26-year-old, an employee at Rosie cafe which is frequented by Mr Key and his wife, recounted on The Daily Blog how the Prime Minister kept playfully pulling her hair despite being told to stop during election time last year. But following the publication of the blog on Wednesday, Mr Key defended his pranks as 'a bit of banter' and said he had already apologised for his actions, Stuff.co.nz reports. Scroll down for video . Amanda Bailey (right) with Jackie Grant and Scott Brown, whose company Hip Group owns Rosie cafe in Auckland where Ms Bailey works.

A waitress has revealed how the New Zealand Prime Minister had repeatedly given her unwanted attention while she was working at a cafe in Auckland frequented by him and his wife Bronagh (pictured together) Ms Bailey told the Herald that she felt Mr Key's behaviour was inappropriate. 'I didn't feel I should have to put up with that,' she said. 'I expected more from him and I want the public to be aware. 'John Key feels he is untouchable.'

'He was like the school yard bully tugging on the little girls' hair trying to get a reaction, experiencing that feeling of power over her,' she wrote. Mr Key kept being persistent with his hair-pulling antics, despite being told by his wife Bronagh to stop. After dealing with the practical jokes over the six months he had visited the cafe, the waitress finally lost her cool.

I felt powerless and tormented and I stepped out the back and I cried frustrated tears.' Key, who was en route to the Anzac ceremony in Gallipoli on Wednesday, told reporters he has a very 'warm and friendly relationship' with staff at the cafe. 'When I realised she took offence by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologised and said I was terribly sorry,' he said according to Stuff.co.nz. 'It was all in the context of a bit of banter that was going on, and so obviously I immediately apologised for that. 'She thanked me for that and said ""that's all fine, no drama"".'

Dr George Hamilton, the Chief Apostle of the W.O.R.D. Ministries in Summerville, South Carolina, launched an attack on officer Michael Slager, who killed Scott last week by shooting him five times in the back, referring to him as a 'disgrace'. Hundreds of mourners were crammed inside the small church today, where Scott's casket, draped in an American flag, was led in, accompanied by his distraught mother. The family had a police escort to the funeral. Hamilton continued to rail against Slager, who has been jailed and charged with Scott's murder, during the service. Referring to the cell phone video which shows Scott being gunned down as he tried to run from Slager, he said: 'It's one thing to have a loved one die... It's another to have to watch them die... and see how they died'. Scroll down for videos .

Mother: Judy Scott is pictured getting out of a black limousine at the funeral service for Scott, a 50-year-old father of four . According to ABC News, he continued: 'Walter's death was motivated by racial discrimination. You've got to hate somebody to shoot them in the back. 'This officer is a disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department... You don't tase a man and then shoot him.A badge is not authority to murder.' Hamilton did add that Slager's actions were not representative of all law enforcement, insisting 'We will not indict the entire law enforcement for the act of one racist'. Judy Scott, Walter's mother, was among the hundreds of mourners at the service today, arriving with other family members in a fleet of black limousines to the service for Scott, 50, who was a father of four. Scott, a former coast guard, had been married twice and was engaged to be married to a third woman before he was pulled over for a broken tail light by Slager, who shot him five times in the back after a confrontation in North Charleston. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. U.S. senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. After the funeral Rep. Clyburn, said he wanted national strategies and standards for law enforcement to be considered. Referring to the suggestion that officers be made to wear body-mounted cameras, he said: 'Body cameras are a good start. They're certainly not a panacea'. In an obituary Scott's family focused on his love for his friends and family, devotion to God, and appreciation for the Dallas Cowboys. At a wake yesterday his casket had also been adorned with Cowboys memorabilia. The obituary said: 'Walter was born in February 9, 1965 native of Charleston, SC area. He attended the Charleston County School System. He proudly served his country by enlisting in the National Coast Guard in 1984 where he was stationed in Baltimore, Maryland. 'He received his massage therapist degree from Miller Motte in 2006. He leaves to mourn loving parents, Elder Walter and Minister Judy G Scott, two brothers Anthony N. Scott and Rodney E.

'Walter loved the Lord; and he expressed it by singing in the choir. He loved all of his family and friends and often embraced others as family. He was a true fan of the Dallas Cowboys.' Scott worked as a forklift truck driver and had served in the Coast Guard in the 1980s. Police escorted a hearse headed towards W.O.R.D. Ministries in Summerville, South Carolina. Mourners waited through light rain as flowers were unloaded and taken to the sanctuary. His family, with a police escort, arrived at the church around 11am in a fleet of three black limousines. Dozens of mourners who were lined up outside the church held up their cellphones trying to capture the scene as Scott's casket was unloaded from the hearse and wheeled into the church.

Local dignitaries: U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn (left, D-SC) attended the funeral, as did Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon (right) Embrace: Two funeral attendees embrace in the rain during the funeral for Scott, held a week after he was shot dead . Tributes: Men carry flowers into the church where Scott's service is being held today. An obituary praised his loving nature and generosity towards family and friends . Sadness: Mourners in Summerville leaned on one another ahead of the service for Scott, who has four children aged 16-24 . The family said they decided to keep the press away after the New York Daily News reported that they had banned Al Sharpton from the funeral - a claim the family and Sharpton have refuted. A wake for Scott was held yesterday, at which his open casket was on display and adorned with Dallas Cowboys memorabilia. At the time he was stopped, Scott owed some $18,000 in child support payments, which family said may have been why he tried to run from Slager. His brother, Rodney Scott, said: 'He had trouble keeping up with the payments, that's all, and he knew he would go to jail. 'His mission was to avoid the police as much as possible.' Dash cam video from Slager's patrol car has shown him pulling over Scott, who got out of his car and ran while the officer's back was turned. Court records show Scott last paid child support in 2012 and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued in early 2013. Scott had been in jail three times since 2008. Rodney Scott said his brother would take long detours while driving to their parents' house because he thought there were more police patrolling the direct, 10-minute route from his home. He said Walter also tried to make sure any vehicle he drove had working headlights and taillights. Some of the city's black residents have told similar stories about being stopped by police over minor infractions or simply avoiding police altogether. Killing: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . It emerged yesterday that Scott had also been jailed in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery. A report released by the Charleston County Sheriff's Department on Friday said they had to break up a fight between Scott and another man, during which he shoved a deputy to the floor. Despite Scott's record, those who knew him remember Scott as lighthearted and gentle. They describe a laid-back, fun-loving man who took his girlfriend dancing on weekends, entertained family and friends with backyard cookouts and hosted regular domino games. 'This is a long time coming, but now that it has come all of those things have to be recognized. It's so sad that it happened like that because a lot of this stuff has been on the backburner for a long time,' Ernest Murray, 73, said during Scott's wake. 'He wouldn't hurt a fly, man,' said Ronald Smith, 29, a co-worker who often got advice on marriage and other life decisions from Scott when the older man gave him a lift home after their shift. 'All of us looked up to him.'","Service for Scott, 50, in Summerville, South Carolina, was attended by hundreds of mourners .

11086,0953a85cee13aba3aebad5a7f625349e9a848679,"Salads in British supermarkets are being grown by workers treated like ‘slaves’ who live in filthy conditions, an investigation has found. Migrant workers producing vegetables exported to Britain say they are denied basic hygiene facilities while working and are forced to use bushes near where the vegetables are being grown as toilets. They are not provided with soap or water to wash their hands, while some live in filthy shacks made of wood and plastic sheeting near the fields in southern Spain. They claim they are treated like slaves by agencies who hire them to produce the salads and vegetables that end up on supermarket shelves in Britain, the investigation by Channel 4 News found. They also say they are made to work around dangerous pesticides – causing some to fall ill – and are routinely left unpaid for hours they have worked. The revelations will horrify millions of customers of British supermarkets, all of which tell consumers their food is produced ethically and that workers are treated fairly. And they will lead to claims that the bitter price war which has seen supermarkets slash prices in a bid to compete with discounters Aldi and Lidl has led to ruthless exploitation of the vulnerable. A firm that supplies salad and vegetables to Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda is among those accused of using mistreated workersSome workers say they have developed horrific sinus conditions and bronchitis as a result of being sprayed with the pesticides while producing the vegetables in the fields of Murcia. Cleaning: Some live in filthy shacks made of wood and plastic sheeting near the fields in Almeria southern Spain . Yesterday British politicians demanded an urgent investigation, saying the evidence was ‘appalling’ and appeared to show ‘effectively slave labour producing food in 2015’. Sainsbury’s and Waitrose said they would investigate immediately. All the major British supermarkets claim they source food responsibly. And they have all signed up to tough rules to promote workers’ rights under the global Ethical Trading Initiative, designed to protect labourers. The revelations centre on workers in Murcia and Almeria from where millions of pounds worth of vegetables are exported to the UK every year. Workers in one field in Murcia were filmed being sprayed with pesticides. One vegetable picker working for a firm in Almeria supplying courgettes to the UK told of the filthy conditions in which he was made to work. ‘For the toilet you have to go in the bushes,’ he said. ‘What is there to clean yourself? For these courgettes to reach England, there are workers who have suffered a lot.’ Growing trade: The workers say they have to work around dangerous pesticides - causing some to fall ill . He said workers at his company, based in Almeria, were also sprayed with pesticides but were too afraid to complain because their names would be put on a blacklist known as ‘the list of rotten sardines’. Lettuce: The revelations will lead to claims that the bitter supermarket price war has led to ruthless exploitation of the vulnerable . The investigation also uncovered concerns about workers for Agroherni, a Murcia firm which sells £22million worth of salad, herbs and vegetables a year to Britain’s major supermarkets including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. It is not alleged that Agroherni's workers are forced to live  in dirty conditions or work without sanitation, but one former employee told how she had been left in agonising pain and needed multiple operations on her sinuses after working in fields where pesticides were being sprayed. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘All that matters to them is fulfilling their clients’ orders.’ Agroherni uses an employment agency called Integra Empleo to provide workers to pick the produce in its fields, but the workers say the agency routinely denies them pay. One lettuce picker said: ‘If we work 26 days, they write down 16 or 18. They always steal seven or eight days.’ Last night Tory Richard Drax, a former member of the Environment and Rural Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘If true, these allegations are appalling. It sounds like effectively slave labour producing food in 2015 which is utterly unacceptable. ‘Supermarkets must explain themselves. It is up to them to know who is producing their food and in what conditions.’ Tory Neil Parish, a colleague on the committee, said: ‘There is always a price to pay for cheap imported food; whether it is poor quality, low animal welfare standards or, in this case, the appalling treatment of workers.’ More than 40 employment agencies supply labour to farm growers in the Murcia region. All the top supermarkets say they abide by the Ethical Trading Initiative. Tesco says it has local ethical trade managers on the ground who investigate claims locally. Bagged up: The revelations will horrify millions of customers of British supermarkets (file picture) But it is thought the companies who are major suppliers to the supermarkets get round the rules by using employment agencies who cut corners to save money. Both Agroherni and Integra Empleo deny all the allegations and say they have launched investigations into the claims. Probe: Sainsbury’s (pictured) and Waitrose said they would investigate the findings immediately . Agroherni said it maintains a strict procedure with regard to the use of pesticides and is not aware of any relevant incidents. It strongly denied that it mistreats or exploits agency workers and said the fair treatment and safety of workers was paramount. However as a result of the Channel 4 News investigation it has ceased working with Integra Empleo and is to employ the workers directly. A Sainsbury’s spokesman said: ‘We expect our suppliers to adhere to the highest quality and welfare standards, regardless of where they operate in the world. We are taking these allegations very seriously and will be conducting our own investigation.’ A Waitrose spokesman said: ‘Worker welfare is very important to us – our supplier is investigating these allegations and will ensure that our high standards are being met.’ A spokesman for the British Retail Consortium which represents all the supermarkets said: ‘Ensuring workers are treated fairly in our supply chains is a key concern for retailers. We know all supermarkets will examine these allegations closely.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Vegetables sold in UK are grown by workers 'denied basic hygiene facilities' in Almeria, Spain .

6660,e8b93366b9c9c5bf4409dc1f8064122063ccd4ca,"After two months and more than 100 witnesses, the prosecution has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez. The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.","Prosecutors have called more than 100 witnesses to testify .

487,4b1f1502773e8456675705204e5bc6e444fd1fae,"Accused: Officer Aaron Stringer, from Bakersfield, California, allegedly pulled on the toes and 'tickled' the feet of a man whom police had recently killed . A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet . Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above . She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own.

Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.","Willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes .

Maria Malone-Guerbaa, 41, from London, used nothing but paints to turn herself into an uncanny painting of a grey rabbit with blue eyes, wearing a red bow tie. The mother-of-two said she didn't use any prosthetics or special effects to achieve the amazing result. Scroll down for video . Make-up artist Maria Malone-Guerbaa (left) just used paints to transform herself into a bunny . The final result took three hours to achieve after Maria simply googled pictures of bunnies, picking one she liked best and replicating the image on her face. She used her own brushes and kryolan paint, special dense, long-lasting make-up used by professionals working with stage actors. Maria began her project by painting a white base layer to create the shape of the rabbit's face and ears, adding the animal's eyes (below her own) and nose and mouth (over her own). The sides of her face and forehead was then painted with black paint, to form the bunny's entire head. With grey paint, black dots stippled over the top and finally details like whiskers, and the bow tie that is drawn from Maria's neck up to her chin, the look was complete. Maria explained her inspiration for her rabbit scheme: 'My last couple of projects have been animal-themed so, with Easter coming up, it had to be a rabbit this time around. 'It takes me about three hours in total and I'll stop every 20 minutes or so to take a picture of my progress. 'I just went on my iPhone and searched for rabbits on Google Images. You get so many then that you can just form your own picture.' The final result has earned thousands of likes on Instagram, along with her other posts showing how she transformed her face into Jack Nicholson from The Shining, Stevie Wonder, a cougar and Freddie Mercury. Maria used only her brushes and professional kryolan paints to create bunny ears, bright eyes and a nose . She captioned the picture: 'I've got #hare in my face!' She said: 'It's amazing to see other people enjoying my work. I can't quite put into words how flattering it is and it makes the whole thing worthwhile. 'One lady even got in touch who'd been inspired to try it out herself. That was the pinnacle for me: it was so humbling to think that my work had inspired someone else to do the same thing.' Originally from Limerick, Maria says she's always had a passion for art but only began doing celebrity lookalikes after she started face painting for parties for her children Sophia, 14, and Adam, 11.

3944,46989538fdcf535681ed8afbf3c60dc71565b39a,"The former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes  is suing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers accusing them of unsanitary conditions that led to a MRSA infection  that he says ended his career. The 36-year-old is seeking $20million in lost future earnings and $15,000 in damages after he contracted the deadly infection in 2013 following a surgery on an ingrown toenail, according to  Albert Breer of the NFL Network. The lawsuit was announced on Monday and alleges that the Buccaneers 'failed to disclose and actively concealed ongoing incidents of the infection among other individuals' who used  team's facilities, according to ESPN. Lawrence Tynes has filed a lawsuit against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for $20million in lost future earnings . Tynes was in training camp with the Buccaneers in 2013 when he contracted the deadly MRSA infection . The suit also claims that the team did not use necessary sterile techniques and routinely left therapy devices, equipment and surfaces unclean, according to ESPN. Tynes and another player, offensive guard Carl Nicks, both contracted Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections during a July 2013 outbreak of the  infection during the Buccaneers' summer training camp prior to the season. Nicks reached a settlement with the team last year over his infection for $3million, according to Deadspin. Tynes, who has not kicked a football since 2012, said that he spent eight or nine days without being diagnosed and his infection worsened. 'No one cultured my toe at the facility,' he told ESPN. 'I left that facility on my own and found a doctor in town and said, 'Can you look at my toe because I think all the doctors at the Bucs are lying to me.' The former kicker is seeking an additional $15,000 in damages and says the infection has ended his career . The lawsuit claims that the team did not use necessary sterile techniques and routinely left therapy devices, equipment and surfaces unclean . 'And I took my sock off, he looks at my toe, without any scientific study or anything, he said, 'You have MRSA.' And I'm at a billion-dollar company with the supposed best doctors in the world, and not one of them told me that I had that? I know they knew I had it. They just didn't want me to have it.' He also told ESPN he nearly had his toe amputated due to MRSA, and said that because of the pain in his toe he can longer play. After he contracted the infection, Tynes was  placed on the non-football injury list (NFI) by the team just before the season began. MRSA is usually contracted by people in hospitals or other medical facilities. It is resistant to most antibiotic treatments and can lead to deadly flesh-eating bacteria. The infection can remain in the body for years while being treated. The superbug killed more people than AIDS in 2011. Source: Centers for Disease Control . The NFI list is the team's way of denying . liability after he contracted the precursor for flesh-eating bacteria, . which denies him of certain benefits he is eligible for while on IR. Players on IR reserve their full salary, an accrued season (towards both free agency and retirement benefits) and full health insurance – players on NFI receive none of those benefits. First infected after a July 30 procedure to remove an ingrown toenail on his kicking foot, in earlier reports Tynes said he went to the team after his foot became red and swollen within a few days. Six different antibiotics and three surgical procedures later, he previously told Fox Sports that the team was denying liability. 'I'm standing up for what I think is right,' Tynes told ESPN. 'Or what I know is right. I'm in this thing 'til the very end. I'm not going away.' The former New York Giants postseason hero had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line hooked directly to his veins to more efficiently get antibiotics into his system to fight the infection, according to Fox Sports. The kicker's plight was first brought to the nation's attention by his wife after Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano told media the infected players were 'responding well' to treatment. 'I hear my husband is responding 'well' to treatment. LOL! He's NOT responding at all yet. This is our #bucslife,' Amanda Tynes tweeted August 13, 2013 with a picture of her ailing husband on the couch, hooked up to an intravenous drip. Less than a month later, with their kicker still sidelined and hopes of him recovering in time to contribute to the 2013 season dwindling, the Buccaneers informed the two-time Super Bowl champion the weekend before the season opener that he would be placed on the non-football injury list, further infuriating him and his wife. Tynes (9) twice kicked the New York Giants to the Super Bowl with NFC Championship-winning overtime field goals . 'The Bucs informed my husband via EMAIL that he will be placed on NFI. Wouldn't expect anything more from such a classy organization,' Amanda Tynes tweeted at the time. 'Historically, other teams have done the right thing,' said Lawrence Tynes. 'Other players who have had staph or MRSA, the appropriate designation is IR.' MRSA infections are resistant to most bacteria and, if untreated, can turn deadly. They are usually diagnosed in people who have been in hospitals or had medical procedures and can take years to overcome, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Tynes took to the airwaves to voice his concerns and speak out against what he felt was negligent treatment by the team. He signed a one-year contract with the Buccaneers prior to the 2013 season after a six-year stint with the Giants, where he became famous for twice nailing field goals in overtime that sent his team to the Super Bowl. Tynes started his career with the Kansas City Chiefs.","Lawrence Tynes contracted the deadly infection after surgery on his foot in 2013 and is now seeking an additional $15,000 in damages .

But they were snatched when the couple weren’t looking – and neighbours believe they have caught the culprit on CCTV. Caught on camera: This is the suspected dog-napper seen on CCTV footage with what appears to be two animals under his arms . ‘We just want them back,’ said Mrs Worgan, 49. ‘It’s devastating. None of us have been able to sleep or eat since.’ Mr Worgan was inside the house in Doncaster at around midday when he heard a yelp from the garden. He rushed outside in time to see a man get into a van with Marley and Mitzy and drive off.

3251,02e7ee52406518338ea1d184af26d107a3c0ab7c,"A shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya has been released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the west of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. This follows another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film. It raises fears that ISIS is consolidating its presence on the 'doorstep of Europe', as Libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of Italy. Scroll down for video . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video. Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Ethiopia was unable to confirm its citizens were killed in the footage but condemned the 'atrocious act', a government official said. The video shows the men at the coast wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits and being held at the neck by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces. The victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles. It starts with what it called a 'history of Christian-Muslim relations', which includes scenes of militants destroying churches, graves and icons. A masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill Christians if they do not convert. In an apparent reference to Ethiopia's attacks on neighbouring Somalia, whose population is almost entirely Muslim, he says: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again.' The footage, which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to ISIS, also cuts to Christians in Syria explaining how they were given the choice of converting to Islam or paying a 'special tax'. At the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point-blank range and the others beheaded on the beach. The video has not yet been verified. The men - wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits - are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces . The men, thought to be migrant works, are described by Islamic State in the video as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church' The footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area, believed to be in the south of the country, by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats . A masked fighter in black (right) brandishing a pistol vows to kill Christians if they do not convert, saying: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again' The victims are forced to kneel in front of the militants (above) before being shot at point-blank range simultaneously. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group . The militant in black - who is completely covered apart from his eyes - remains flanked by two people holding guns throughout the clip . Ethiopia is a predominantly Christian country with the religion being introduced in the country the 4th century, making it one of the oldest Christian states in the world. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is one of the oldest organized Christian bodies in the world, and more than 40 per cent of the population are members of the church. Around 20 per cent of the population follow other branches of Christianity, a majority being Protestant. Islam was not introduced in the country for another 300 years, and now about one third of Ethiopians identify as Muslim. Initial reports did not make clear who the captives were or when they were captured. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group. Redwan Hussein, an Ethiopian government spokesman, said officials were in contact with its embassy in Cairo to verify the video's authenticity. He said he believed those killed were likely to have been Ethiopian migrants hoping to reach Europe. Libya has become a hub for migrants across Africa hoping to cross the Mediterranean to enter Europe for work and better lives. 'If this is confirmed, it will be a warning to people who wish to risk and travel to Europe though the dangerous route,' Mr Hussein said. He added that Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Libya, would help repatriate Ethiopians if they wanted to leave. Libyan officials were not immediately available for comment. Abba Kaletsidk Mulugeta, an official with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church's Patriarchate Office, said he also believed the victims  were likely to have been migrants. 'I believe this is just another case of the IS group killing Christians in the name of Islam. Our fellow citizens have just been killed on a faith-based violence that is totally unacceptable. This is outrageous,' he said. 'No religion orders the killing of other people, even people from another religion.' Ethiopia's options to retaliate remain slim, given its distance from Libya. However, Ethiopian Ambassador to Egypt Mohammed Edrees said his country could partner with Cairo to strike the militants. 'That could be an option,' Mr Edrees said. 'We will see and explore what is possible to deal with group.' It comes just two months after the extremist group in Libya beheaded 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a beach (above) The latest video mirrored a film released in February showing militants beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach (pictured above), which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya . Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate for the Middle East Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: 'The Islamic State in Libya is still focused on this consolidation phase of announcing its presence through these very high-profile executions. But they face some structural limits in terms of how much local support they can get because they haven't captured real revenue streams.' It comes just two months after IS militants  filmed themselves beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a similar beach, which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya. ISIS has been able to gain a foothold amid chaos in Libya, where two governments backed by rival alliances of militias are battling each other as well as extremist groups. The group is also advancing in Iraq, where it has captured three villages near the city of Ramadi. Islamic State fighters, pictured carrying flags and dressed in black, have been able to gain a foothold amid the chaos in Libya . More than 90,000 people have fled the ISIS's advance in Anbar, a United Nations humanitarian agency said earlier this morning. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that civilians are fleeing Ramadi as well as the three nearby villages captured by the IS group a few days ago. Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said: 'Our top priority is delivering life-saving assistance to people who are fleeing - food, water and shelter are highest on the list of priorities.' Iraqi officials in Anbar have described Ramadi as a ghost town, with empty streets and closed shops. Iraqi troops backed by Shiite militias and U.S.-led airstrikes managed to dislodge ISIS, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria and wants to redraw the map of the Middle East, from the northern city of Tikrit earlier this month. But the troops have struggled against the militants in Anbar, which saw some of the heaviest fighting of the eight-year U.S. military intervention that ended in 2011. Elsewhere today, the US-led coalition said Kurdish forces recaptured 11 villages in Iraq's Kirkuk province from ISIS following days of intense clashes. The coalition said the area of about 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) was south of the city of Kirkuk.","Video seems to show militants in Libya holding one group of at least 16 captive on a beach and 12 others in a desert .

The French midfielder had just put in a dominant display at the Emirates Stadium as the Ligue 1 side all-but-sealed their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League after a 3-1 first-leg win. But rather than Arsenal, it now seems Liverpool hold the main Premier League interest in the 22-year-old. So, what more do you need to know? Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia is a Liverpool target and has also interested Arsenal in recent years . 22? He's been around for a while... Despite his young age, Kondogbia has amassed over 100 league appearances for Lens, Monaco, and even Sevilla. And during that five-year professional career, the central midfielder has been constantly watched by Arsenal scouts. He also impressed at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup alongside Paul Pogba in the French midfield, while his frame and playing style doesn't exactly scream 22 years old. Kondogbia is only 22 but has racked up over 100 league appearances with Lens (above), Sevilla and Monaco . The central midfielder was a key player for France alongside Paul Pogba at the Under 20 World Cup in 2013 . Tough guy then? Exactly. Standing at 6'2"", Kondogbia is a real presence in the Monaco midfield, allowing the likes of Joao Moutinho to strut their stuff further forward. He's strong in the tackle, but make no mistake, his prowess on the ball is also impressive. Possessing a fine left foot, Kondogbia doubles up as a playmaker, and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against Arsenal. Having made his mark in both Ligue 1 and La Liga, you could say the Frenchman is the perfectly well-rounded midfielder, someone who would fit in seamlessly in the Premier League... Kondogbia's fine strike put Monaco in front against Arsenal in the Champions League last-16 first leg . So why haven't we seen him in England? Time is still on Kondogbia's side, but Premier League clubs have certainly tried. Arsenal were heavily linked with him before he left Sevilla, though the versatile player bought out his contract and opted for Monaco. With Liverpool crying out for players to freshen up an ageing/departing spine, the 22-year-old's presence would surely suit Brendan Rodgers. But he must move quick, with Real Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus and Paris St Germain all keen to sign the man who has been capped three times by his national team.

There has been fresh talk this week of Real Madrid being interested in the goalkeeper, with it even being suggested in Spain that talks had opened between the club, Begovic's representatives and his current employers. But, at his press conference to preview Saturday's Barclays Premier League home clash with Southampton, Hughes said: 'There will be a lot of stories bandied about, but I would take that one with a pinch of salt to be perfectly honest. I don't think that is true.' Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic has been linked with a summer move to Spanish giants Real Madrid . The Bosnia international has been one of the Premier League's most consistent keepers . Potters boss Mark Hughes has played down reports of Begovic leaving the Brittania Stadium . Begovic is out of contract in 2016 and Hughes has repeatedly emphasised his optimism the 27-year-old Bosnia international will sign a new deal with Stoke this summer. 'We are scheduled to have talks with Asmir's people in the next few weeks I think,' the manager said on Friday. 'I think both parties have stated that probably at the end of the season those talks will come to a conclusion, and we are very hopeful Asmir will stay here. 'There will be speculation around better players at football clubs, and we are no different. He has attracted attention because he is an outstanding goalkeeper.' In terms of other potential items of summer business, Hughes is also hopeful Stoke will wrap up the signing of teenage winger Moha El Ouriachi from Barcelona. It was reported earlier this week that the 19-year-old Moroccan-born player was bound for the Potters this summer after deciding joining them was a better option than accepting the new contract offer made to him by Barca. And Hughes said on Friday: 'There is a hope that we will be able to conclude that deal.' Barcelona B winger Moha El Ouriachi is set to sign for Stoke City, according to the player's agent . Stoke have already signed Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa from Barcelona in the last two years . The Welshman, who is a former Barcelona striker and who has previously signed forward Bojan Krkic and defender Marc Muniesa for Stoke from the Catalan outfit, added: 'We are trying to improve the quality of the Under-21 group and he (El Ouriachi) is a good young player. 'He is one we think we can bring to the club, so we will try to pursue that one and it looks very hopeful. 'He is predominantly left-footed, has good ability one on one and has good pace. He ticks a lot of the boxes in terms of what we are looking for in young players. 'If we can get it concluded, once he is here then we hope to develop him and push him towards the first team if we can. 'He is not one that is going to go straight into my team, but it is with a view that in the future it will happen.' Stoke will be without Muniesa and winger Victor Moses for Saturday's contest. Stoke will be without winger Victor Moses after the Chelsea loanee picked up a hamstring injury . Muniesa misses out due to a slight hamstring strain, while on-loan Moses has returned to parent club Chelsea because of a hamstring problem of his own that is expected to keep him sidelined for the rest of the season. Defenders Marc Wilson and Erik Pieters are both nursing knocks to the wrist but Hughes feels the pair should be available for the visit of the Saints. Meanwhile, Potters forward Peter Odemwingie returned to full training on Thursday as his recovery from the knee injury that has kept him sidelined since August goes on, with a return to first-team action before the end of the campaign his target. As a club, 10th-placed Stoke are continuing to work towards the goal of bettering their record Premier League haul of 50 points achieved last season when Hughes guided them to their best finish in the division of ninth. Nigerian forward Peter Odenwingie has returned to training after a lengthy spell on the sidelines . They currently have 43 points and the game against sixth-placed Southampton is the first of six more games they have left to play this term. Hughes' men have not won in their last four matches but picked up their first point in that sequence last time out with a 1-1 draw at West Ham, and he is adamant the campaign is not petering out. 'We have our own things we want to chase and achieve this year,' Hughes said. 'They are still very much there for us, so the challenge is to keep our focus. 'I was really pleased with the performance at West Ham. If we were a team looking ahead to the summer break, we wouldn't have been able to score as late as we did (stoppage time).'","Mark Hughes has played down reports linking keeper with Real Madrid .

3352,a23bdac917f9f65647c2b42a4e625b5070d23624,"Labour were left embarrassed tonight after it was forced to remove a signatory to a letter of support after she was exposed as a benefit cheat who had swindled nearly £30,000. Campaign chiefs attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’. The signatories, who said they were ‘all working people’, warned about the ‘proliferation of zero-hours contracts’ they claimed were ‘letting down Britain’ and showed that ‘we need a Labour Government to put working people first’. Labour attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’ But within hours the plan was in chaos as it was found the signatories included a benefit fraudster, trade unionists and the cigar-smoking children of millionaires. One of the signatories identified herself as someone who had ‘worked on [a] zero hours contract’, but Labour removed her name yesterday after it was revealed she had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012. A court in Manchester heard that the woman moved to Britain after she had a ‘marriage of convenience’ in Nigeria in December 2007. According to tax officials she lived with her ‘husband’, who was the holder of a British passport, ‘briefly or not at all’. She was not entitled to benefits as she was subject to ‘immigration control’, but she submitted a tax credits application and a child benefit claim for three children, two of whom didn’t live with her. The court heard that she moved in with a new partner but claimed £27,888 tax credits in two and a half years as a single person. David Cameron, visiting pupils during his visit to King's Leadership Academy in Warrington today, hailed the business letter in support of the Tories . She was caught after she applied for leave to remain in Britain on the basis of her ‘marriage’. Officers found that she had been fraudulently claiming benefits and had allowed others to use her name and national insurance number to work illegally in the UK. In July 2012 she was given a two year suspended jail sentence and a 150-hour community work order after she pleaded guilty to immigration and fraud charges along with her ‘husband’ who had been working at HMRC as a security officer. A Labour spokesman last night said: ‘More than 6,000 people have now signed our letter from all walks of life across the country. Former Red or Dead boss Wayne Hemingway was among the signatories . ‘Of course we were unaware of the background of this person. The fact still remains that the epidemic of zero hours contracts are a symbol of the failure of this Government's economic plan.’ Other signatories included 21-year-old Manchester University students John-Jo Pierce and Rory Somerville. The pair said they were both working on zero hours contracts but their Facebook pages included photographs of them smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie. Mr Pierce, who is studying maths, is registered on the electoral roll at his parents’ £1million house in woodland near Leatherhead, Surrey. His mother Deirdre, 55, yesterday said that he was ‘just a kid’ who ‘knows nothing about politics’ but had signed the letter after he was asked to by a fellow university student ‘he vaguely knows’. She told the Mail: ‘All he did was sign a petition that somebody called Andrea asked everybody to sign. He knows a little but not much. It’s the first time he’s been interested in an election.’ She declined to discuss what work he was doing on a zero hours contract. Mr Somerville, who is in his final year studying economics, is register to vote at his mother's house in an affluent area of Belfast. Mr Pierce was also photographed at a party in front of a sign that said ‘Drugz Room’, but Mrs Pierce said that it was just a ‘joke’ sign that was a reference to the U.S. television programme Breaking Bad. She said: ‘John-Jo has never done drugs in his life. It’s a joke about Breaking Bad. That’s what people of that age do. They all make jokes about Breaking Bad.’ Mr Somerville did not respond to a request to comment.","Signatory to letter backing Labour was given suspended sentence .

9116,d5d1809a32a3efb8b52e4c60faed8791617a7d16,"Battleground: Esther McVey, who won her Wirral West seat in 2010 with a majority of just 2,436, has demanded that Ed Miliband condemns the attacks . Tory minister Esther McVey has called on Ed Miliband to condemn the ‘scurrilous’ campaign against her after she was branded ‘murderer McVey’ in graffiti. The employment minister also had an election song written about her by  rivals claiming she was going to hell. Miss McVey has been one of the party’s most prominent rising stars, but is the Tory Cabinet minister most at risk of becoming a casualty on election night with a fierce battle to cling on to her marginal Wirral West seat. Yesterday the former GMTV presenter, who won in 2010 with a majority of just 2,436, insisted that she would not be cowered by the ‘misogynistic and sexist’ attacks that she said showed what the Labour party really thinks of women. ‘If they think by coming in the dead of the night and scribbling on a wall and by being anonymous on Twitter that they will intimidate and bully me they are picking on the wrong person,’ she said. ‘I believe it is right that we have a Conservative MP up here who is sitting at the table at Cabinet, so their underhand tactics won’t bully and intimidate me.’ Miss McVey, who was given a job in the Cabinet by David Cameron last July, said that she is one of a number of women sat around the table who knows how to have her voice heard and shows the party is not solely made up of women in ‘twin-sets and pearls’. She also revealed how the network of female Tory ministers, including Home Secretary Theresa May, support each other with text messages, phone calls and by taking each other out for drinks. Miss McVey, who is the only Conservative MP on Merseyside, said her political opponents are trying to create ‘an atmosphere of fear’ in her seat. Local trade union activists launched their ‘Sack Esther McVey’ campaign last year on her birthday and a song with the same name has been recorded and posted on the internet. The vile lyrics claim that Miss McVey ‘torments the sick and poor’, ‘is going to hell’ and that ‘the wicked witch of the Wirral’s had her day’. Last year Labour MP John McDonnell joked that her constituents want to ‘lynch the b*****d’ and last week John Prescott accused her of being ‘heartless’. At a Labour rally in her constituency, the former Labour deputy prime minister claimed to forget her name and said he only remembered her because of the dress she wore into Downing Street when she was promoted. The job centre in Hoylake, at the centre of her constituency, was also targeted with graffiti at the end of last month that read: ‘McVey murderer.’ Miss McVey said: ‘Of course it’s hurtful, not just to me, but more so sometimes for your family and friends. ‘I have to say, John Prescott has never been good with words. He doesn’t know my name and he has shown he knows a big fat zero about me as well. ‘I am totally driven by my heart and my head. You cannot give away what you have not got, but you have got to have the right motives. I wouldn’t believe in social mobility if I didn’t have a heart.’ Message: Graffiti on Wirral job centre accusing MP Esther McVey of being a murderer in one of a number of attacks . Defiant: The former GMTV presenter, pictured yesterday with Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, right, and her campaign team spoke out about being targeted in offensive graffiti and songs . Miss McVey said that despite the personal attacks she is not afraid to go out canvassing by herself. She said: ‘Oh yeah of course I do. I live here. I walk down here. I go canvassing by myself all the time. ‘They’re trying to paint a very ugly picture and trying to create an atmosphere of fear, but that is not the case. The people of Wirral West are not like that.’ She added: ‘The attacks have been misogynistic and sexist and I find it rather mystifying how the Labour party purports to be a party for a woman and yet have run this scurrilous campaign against me and at no time has it been condemned by Ed Miliband. ‘I think this myth that they’re for women is only a myth and the reality is the campaign they have run against me shows what they truly think about women.’ Miss McVey, who was one of only five ministers to make it onto the front page of the Conservative manifesto alongside Mr Cameron, hit back at suggestions she was only there as a ‘token woman’. She said: ‘I believe I was there because as minister for employment we have seen a record number of jobs created in the economy, two million jobs.’ After earlier this year revealing her ambition to one day become prime minister, Miss McVey said she hopes that another woman will become Tory leader in her lifetime. She said: ‘Every time requires a different leader and hopefully in our lifetimes there will be time when another woman is needed as leader.’ As she hosted a women business leaders event in her constituency yesterday alongside Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Lords Leader Baroness Stowell, Miss McVey talked about the support she has received from other women in the Cabinet behind the scenes. She also denied that the Tory party is predominantly made up of women in twin-sets and pearls. ‘No. For me I have never have thought that because the Tory women I knew were not like that,’ she said. ‘The Tory women in this room are just people running a business, looking after a family, there is not anybody here in twin-set and pearls, they are just regular people who understand you cannot spend what you have not got.’ Support: Miss McVey was flanked by Ms Villiers and and felow Tory Grant Shapps on the campaign trail yesterday . Asked if it was easy being only one of only a few women in Cabinet, she said: ‘You have got to look at it from both sides of the table, we might be in lesser numbers but sometimes that can make you more visible and your points more pertinent too. ‘I’m the sort of person who doesn’t look at what could be the difficulties and “oh say I give up”. Look at the difficulties, rise to the challenge and make sure your voice is being heard.’ Miss McVey said that the female Tory ministers exchange text messages, phone calls and go out for drinks together. She said: ‘Of course you are busy doing what you do but there is a support behind the scenes. ‘People like Justine Greening will say “let’s go out for a drink”. ‘Theresa May was chairman of the party when I came in. She was very good at giving the realities of the job, what were the expectations, what support can you have, is there anything else you need to know. ‘Obviously there are phone calls that you have with one another – “how do you deal with that?”, “what do you do?”, “what would your advice be on this?”. ‘There’s personal support and professional support and Theresa May has given both.’ Miss McVey said that she was pleased to see Nicola Sturgeon, Natalie Bennett and Leanne Wood representing their parties in the televised leaders debates even though she disagrees with them politically. She said: ‘Obviously their policies aside, for women to get to the top of their profession, that’s what I have fought for all of my life, I think that’s fantastic.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps, who also visited Miss McVey’s seat yesterday, condemned the campaign against her. He said: ‘I think it’s completely unacceptable and it has to stop. I call on the Labour leadership locally and nationally to reign it in because it is not the sort of civilised debate we should be having.’ Last year the Labour Party said Mr McDonell’s comment did ‘not represent the views of the Labour Party’, but refused to withdraw the whip from him. The local Labour Party has condemned the ‘murder McVey’ graffiti and said it was the council leader who reported the vandalism and ordered its immediate removal.","Esther McVey will not be cowered by 'misogynistic and sexist' attacks .

But not for three women who are not only scoring red carpet gigs and A-list actors but are now being dubbed 'power stylists' in Hollywood Reporter's 'Power Stylist for 2015' hit list, thanks to their A-list Aussie starlets. Scoring sixth place on the list is Elizabeth Stewart, a former fashion editor for Women’s Wear Daily and the New York Times and whose credited with styling Australian actress Cate Blanchett as well as mega stars including Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Amanda Seyfried.

Popular Australian comedian Rebel Wilson also recently enlisted Stewart's style advice in a bid to bring a sense of 'classiness' to her image in Tinseltown. Stewart was also voted number one stylist on The Hollywood Reporter's Power Stylist list last year, and was also blamed for causing a major fashion stir for having Blanchett (dubbed ‘the darling of Hollywood’) be the first to step out in a black frayed dress for Maison Margiela by John Galliano (after the disgraced designer left Valentino) during her Blue Jasmine acclaim. Also notably scoring eighth place was Cristina Elrich, the stylist responsible for creating a fresh faced glamour look for Aussie beauty Margot Robbie (during both her blonde and brunette red carpet appearances) and an Amazonian style for mystical Australian actress Isabel Lucas. Style sisters: Jeanann Williams, Naomi Watts' longtime stylist, placed ninth on the list . Personal and professional: Jeannan also used to date Naomi's brother Ben, and the pair share a daughter . Elrich’s other accolades include styling stars such as Penelope Cruz, Jessica Biel and Girls star Allison Williams. Straight after Elrich is Naomi Watts's stylist Jeann Williams, making the hit list at number nine. Williams manages to keep the ‘Diana’ star on the watch list every event (and is also well versed in maintain Watt’s partner Liev Shreiber’s dapper look beside her on the red carpet). Williams has had a strong advantage with her A-list clientele, when Watt’s, one of her most famous, is also the Aunt to her daughter (Williams used to date Watt’s brother acclaimed photographer Ben Watts).

5130,c868e5977a60be4bb8f74611c058bcb9109137e2,"A mother-of-three repeatedly knifed in the head by her violent boyfriend has revealed how she begged him to put her to bed so she didn't die on the floor. Joanne Bolton told how she thought she was going to die at the hands of Steven Young during the 'brutal and merciless' seven hour long ordeal. The 35-year-old was stabbed over 14 times before being knocked out with a mental bar after being held captive in her own home. Joanne Bolton, pictured in hospital,  did not believe she was going to survive the horrific attack that saw her knifed more than 14 times . Such was the force of the attack, that the blade of a knife being used to stab her in the head broke. But this did not end the nightmare, instead Young chose a bigger weapon and continued his violent onslaught. 'I didn't think I was going to survive and I asked him to put me to bed because I didn't want to die on the floor,' said Miss Bolton of New Kyo, Stanley, County Durham. 'I felt euphoric, I stopped feeling the cold and had no strength left. I knew I didn't have long left.' Miss Bolton was already fleeing from a violent relationship when she met Young and jumped at the chance to move in with him after staying in a refuge. But soon after he became possessive and violent and started using her a punchbag as he fought his own insecurities. Steven Young, pictured right,  was jailed for 18 years by a judge at Newcastle Crown Court after he admitted attempted murder of Miss Bolton, pictured left, shortly after the seven hour ordeal . Miss Bolton, a former support worker, says he was using drugs and was on prescribed methadone which led to paranoia at times. But in May he exploded after she had posted a photo and message on Facebook saying she was unhappy. 'He would wind himself up to breaking point. He would say I was cheating on him but it was him cheating on me,' she said. 'But on that day I had been outside fixing my car and had been talking to a young lad who collects scrap metal. 'He [Young] was upset because of the Facebook message. I went into the kitchen and opened a tin of tuna and he stuck a six inch knife in my head. 'The blade was sticking in my head and I thought 'oh my God, I'm going to die'. I couldn't pull it out but he did. 'He pulled it so hard it gave me whiplash and the blade snapped on the way out and fell on the floor. He went for another big knife and he stabbed me in the back and it punctured my kidney. 'He then stabbed me twice in the chest - once in the breast and once in the lung. My lung was filling with blood, I knew I was in trouble and I was coughing up blood. The mother-of-three  has been left scarred for life and needed more than 100 stitches to her face, arms and body . 'I didn't feel the stabs, it just felt like punches, I feel more pain in my dreams now. 'He kept telling me I was going to die and was trying to stab me in the eyes and kept lunging and stabbing me in the head and face, over and over and over again. I put my arm up to protect myself. 'He cut through the nerves, tendons, veins and ligaments above my wrist, blood spurted out. 'From my wrist it was hanging off. He then stabbed me in the thumb, I needed over 100 stitches in total.' Young pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was given an 18-year sentence in February at Newcastle Crown Court. Jailing him, Judge Paul Sloan told him: 'During the attack Miss Bolton truly believed she was going to die and she has suffered profound physical and mental suffering. 'This was a particularly brutal, merciless and sustained attack that must have been truly terrifying for the victim. 'There is a significant risk to members of the public, particularly partners and former partners, of serious harm by you.' Mum-of-three Joanne added: 'I was left in my own pool of blood and I was very cold. 'I was there for hours and then I crawled towards the fire to get warm. 'When I was on my hands and knees he took a power bar and played golf with my head. He hit me in the forehead which flung me backwards then hit me on the shoulder which fractured the bones in my shoulder blade.' Thinking of a way out, gasping for breath, Miss Bolton persuaded Young to put her on the bed and said she had £20 for him to uy drugs. Miss Bolton now suffers with mild brain damage and is often scared to leave the house . On his return she begged him to call an ambulance, saying she would blame her injuries on someone else. She was in intensive care on a ventilator and was in surgery for six hours. 'I had been sterilised when I was 22 because I had real problems during my three births but somehow was pregnant during this,' said Joanne. 'I miscarried after my shoulder operation but that plays heavy on my mind now. 'I never expected to be pregnant again, that was not supposed to happen, but I was and it survived those weeks while this was happening' The frenzied attack has left Joanne with mild brain damage, she struggles to detect smell, has short time memory problems and is often too scared to leave the house. But now new boyfriend Brett Ritchie, 40, of South Stanley, is helping her through her nightmare. 'Brett is different, he is patient, caring and would go to the end of the world and back for me. 'I genuinely feel I am with someone for the right reasons.' Dad-of-six Brett said: 'She has got a lot of trust to gain back and that takes time, but I'm willing to wait because I love her.'","Joanne Bolton was stabbed over 14 times before being battered with a bar .

3527,1aeeb44abc1ac14c4951c9e3842968441edd7526,"Marcelo Bosch basked in the gratitude of his team-mates after kicking Saracens into the semi-finals of the Champions Cup in dramatic scenes in north Paris. Bosch, striking the ball into a strong wind, landed a 55-metre penalty in the final act of the last eight showdown against Racing Metro to snatch a 12-11 victory at the Stade Yves-Du-Manoir. It completed a scarcely believable win given Saracens had been battered for most of the match only to display remarkable tenacity and set up a semi-final appointment with Clermont in St Etienne in two weeks. Marcelo Bosch kicks the winning penalty as Saracens beat Racing Metro 12-11 . Bosch is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring the kick that won his team the game . Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall admitted he was surprised to see Bosch taking the penalty . 'With kicks like this you're either the hero of the day or the bad guy, so I'm happy that it went my way. I just stayed relaxed and fortunately it went through the posts,' Bosch, 31, said. 'Sometimes they ask me if I'm keen to take the long-range kicks and because of the wind it was not a good distance for the other kickers. I said 'why not? I can take it' and the rest is history. 'The last time I did a kick like that was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina. It was from more or less the same range against our classico rivals. 'It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. I tried to be as relaxed as possible because we had the wind in our face and I didn't want to force it. 'It was the last minute of the game so I was tired and tried not to think about what it represented.' Bosch also executed a try-saving tackle on Racing wing Juan Imhoff when all his Argentina team-mate had to do was fall over the line for a potentially decisive final-quarter try. 'Juan is a real player. He's like a striker - always smelling the goal. I followed him and fortunately stopped him from scoring at the end,' Bosch said. Until Bosch delivered the knockout blow - referee Nigel Owens awarded the penalty with 10 seconds left on the clock - a full blooded quarter-final that was often a poor spectacle appeared to be destined for a home win. Saracens fly-half Charlie Hodgson kicked one penalty and full-back Alex Goode supplied six points to keep the match favourites in sight. Two second-half penalties from scrum-half Maxime Machenaud, who also crossed for the game's solitary try in the 27th minute, placed Racing in control that the Parisians only relinquished as Owens was preparing to blow for full time. 'I was surprised to see it was Bosch taking it because I though it was in Alex Goode's range,' Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said. 'But the wind was very strong, so it was Bosch's range. He had the nerve and balls to say he wanted it, which is half the battle. He hit it pretty sweetly. 'Marcelo is pretty cool. He's pretty laid back, but like anybody, that's one of those kicks that if you miss it can cause the damage. 'I'm very grateful that he held his nerve. He also made the tackle on our goalline that kept us in the match as well. Chris Ashton (left) of Saracens is tackled by Juan Imhoff of Racing Metro in the quarter-final clash . Alex Goode (centre) of Saracens sprints with the ball as Jamie Roberts (right) approaches . 'We weren't great in the first half even though we had a very strong wind behind us. But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. 'We went hunting and kept knocking them down and scrapped for absolutely everything.' Racing's Wales centre Jamie Roberts was distraught at the outcome. 'I'm hugely frustrated and gutted for the team. We thought we had it in the bag. That last minute cost us so fair play to Marcelo with the kick at the end,' Roberts said.","Marcelo Bosch secured a  12-11 win for Saracens against Racing Metro .

The brolly-clad thieves targeted supermarkets, convenience stores and electrical shops, swiping £2,000 worth of cigarettes and cars valued at £30,000 in the process. CCTV footage from one of the raids in Tipton, West Midlands, shows the gang using umbrellas to conceal their entrance as they burst into a supermarket, where they stole cash from the offices. Scroll down for video . Umbrella thieves: A gang of armed robbers used pink brollies to confuse staff as they raided 13 shops in a two-month crime spree in the West Midlands . The gang  also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives and screwdrivers, before punching one employee in the face. In a separate raid, the men stole the store manager's Mercedes E200 which they used as their getaway car. The group have now been jailed for more than 27 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to rob. Police caught the thieves following a raid on an Asda supermarket in Coseley, West Midlands, where they were armed with hammers and what was reported to be a gun in a plastic bag.

During the searches, police found fluorescent jackets, identical to those used in the raids, along with banks statements showing large transfers of cash.

They also discovered numerous cash bags from a shop known as Farmfords, one of those targeted by the group, as well as £2,500 in cash. Mobile phones found at the addresses also showed several calls made between the group, while number plate analysis linked the defendants to the areas where the crimes had been committed. Liam Bell, 19, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, and 22-year-old Trea Richardson, from Hansworth, were arrested in June last year, at the time of the warrants being executed. Marcus Morgan, 21, from Tividale, West Midlands, went on the run for five months before being detained in November. Guilty: Ashleigh Evans, 26 (left) from West Bromwich and Marcus Morgan, 21 (right) from Tividale, West Midlands, were jailed for ten years and seven years respectively for their parts in the 13 robberies . Jailed: Liam Bell, 19 (left), from Rowley Regis was jailed for six years and six months while Trea Richardson, 22 (right) from Hansowrth, was sentened to a four-year jail term . Ashleigh Evans, 26, from West Bromwich, was arrested on a flight back from Amsterdam. Officers even found the umbrella captured on CCTV in his luggage. On Friday, Evans was sentenced to 10 years in prison, while Bell was jailed for six years and six months. Richardson received a four-year jail term while Morgan was sentenced to seven years. Sentencing Morgan, Recorder William Mousley QC said to Morgan: 'No doubt you would have seen the fear in the eyes of the people you were robbing yet you carried on thereafter. 'It was not a one-off, it was a course of conduct you decided to engage in quite freely for a few weeks. 'This was professional, commercial robbery for significant financial gain where people were disguised and premises targeted that were vulnerable where people worked hard for not much money. 'They were not the type of premises where workers would expect people like you to come in and rob the store. The only mitigation I can find other than your guilty plea is your youth.' Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Rich Whitehouse, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The money and value of goods stolen, while significant, is nothing compared to the impact these offences have had on the staff members of the targeted premises. 'These offences were carefully planned and the group went to great lengths to conceal their involvement, often using umbrellas as cover when walking from the street to the shops, so as not to draw attention to their face coverings. 'However, the more offences they committed the more arrogant they became. There was also a clear escalation in the type of weapons used in the robberies and I am in no doubt they would have gone on to seriously hurt someone had they not been stopped.'","Thieves raided supermarkets and electrical shops during 55-day spree .

11382,1ecb11d97cc3290881a814fa863c1b06b6b96502,"(CNN)The new emojis are here! On Thursday, Apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won't cut it. The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate, a range of cheers and jeers. Why is any of this important, you may ask? For many, these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting. Rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or even hair color is part of mainstream America -- despite what others might say. This matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day. Think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling. Or more accurately, think of a white face smiling because up until Thursday's update, all the emojis had pale skin. But that has all changed. Now there's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from, including yellow, brown and black.  I'm sure few people will be upset with this development. But how about in December? Why? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include ... Santa Claus. That shrieking sound you may have heard was from Fox News' Megyn Kelly, who famously stated in 2013 that Santa Claus is absolutely, definitely and without a doubt a white guy.  In fact, thanks to Apple, we may even see Brown Santa emojis this December. (Could that mean he's a Muslim Santa?! Cue even more shrieking from Fox News.) There is more. Apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis, kissing with a heart over their heads. This inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on Twitter. It's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same-sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of ""religious liberty."" But it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates might have to say about ""gay emojis."" And I would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay. The fact is, when you embrace diversity, you will still leave out other minority groups. Redheads, for example, are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color. In fact, supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures. Even expanding the flags represented by emojis, as Apple has done, comes at some peril. Apparently Canada is overjoyed that finally Apple has included it. But Armenians are not happy they were left out. I must admit that being partially of Palestinian heritage, it's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a Palestinian state, Apple has chosen to now include a Palestinian flag emoji. Armenia, I feel your pain. Of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is: What took Apple so long? How hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from? That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this. Apple has ""evolved"" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples. Maybe ""religious liberty"" conservatives who discriminate will follow.","Dean Obeidallah: Apple's new emoji lineup is diverse in race, ethnicity and sexual orientation .
It's just like America, but what took Apple so long? Obeidallah asks .
He says change may rankle (or win over?) conservatives who discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation ."

It sums up the approach of many of their fanbase – they haven't fully bought into the idea that City could be one of the giants of Europe. Celebrity fan Ricky Hatton wants 'the old City back', while rock-God City lover Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the fans. Manuel Pellegrini could be worried about his position at Manchester City after losing against their fierce rivals . (Left to right) Segio Aguero, Yaya Toure and James Milner look dejected as they await kick-off after a goal . Boxer Ricky Hatton, pictured at the Etihad for a press conference in 2008, says he wants 'the old City back' Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the City supporters . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of their last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. One of the weirdest things I've been hearing lately is people saying Manuel Pellegrini was the right man at the right time for Manchester City. Their logic is that his calm was needed after the Roberto Mancini reign ended with a fractured dressing room, and an FA Cup final defeat at the hands of Wigan Athletic. Pellegrini is calm but it was the worst kind of short-term thinking which has led to City now clinging on to fourth place. The dressing room calmed down temporarily, but he doesn't have the character or gravitas to galvanise a group of players when the going gets tough. He's punching above his weight at Manchester City. City need to stop pussy-footing around and drag the fans into the modern game. They need to fill up the half-empty glasses of the supporters at the Etihad. Pellegrini's appointment would have suited those fans who resist the charge towards potential greatness. He is not a great manager. Look at his record before he arrived in England. He's done well but there is no evidence of greatness, and no suggestion of greatness to come. Frank Lampard applauds the travelling fans at Old Trafford as he leaves the pitch with goalkeeper Joe Hart . Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Pellegrini after the final whistle at Old Trafford . Jose Mourinho? Ronald Koeman? Sean Dyche? Not even close... Louis van Gaal should be crowned manager of the year . Forget Eden Hazard and Michael Carrick... the best player in the Premier League this weekend was Leicester's Jamie Vardy . And so it has proved. The signings Manchester City have made have also smacked of small-time thinking. They don't go for the great players anymore, they're not in that market. Jesus Navas is the perfect example: he is quick and that's it. He missed a great chance at the start of the Manchester derby because his end product is so poor. He cost a relatively cheap £15million, but at 29 years old (he was signed in 2013), you wonder what the logic was behind this purchase. He's not good enough to be a regular in the starting line-up at a club with ambitions of dominating the Champions League and Barclays Premier League. Why weren't City in the market for Cesc Fabregas? Or Diego Costa? How come they didn't sign Angel di Maria? Financial Fair Play is often used as the excuse – it's holding City back apparently. Look at United, look at Chelsea – be cleverer with the spreadsheets and FFP isn't a problem. Aguero and Jesus Navas prepare for a free-kick at Old Trafford as the latter struggles to inspire the side . Navas is not good enough to be a regular in the starting XI at a club with ambitions of dominating Europe . City opted against going in the market for players such as Cesc Fabregas (left) and Angel di Maria . City's failure to make any kind of serious progress in Europe reflects badly on English football, but the fault is with the club. They need to think bigger and drag themselves towards greatness. Make big signings, they will improve the team, and if they arrive, they will motivate the big players already at City. Yaya Toure strikes me as the kind of player who will raise his game significantly if he had Sami Khedira alongside him, rather than Fernando. The big message out of City this season has been how brilliant and shiny their new academy set-up is. And it is truly spectacular – a world-class facility. But they don't have the team to match it and they absolutely don't have the manager. If they choose to lose Pellegrini, then they need to think big next time and go for a manager showing true potential to be great – like Diego Simeone or Jurgen Klopp. Pellegrini has been accused of punching above his weight at Premier League champions City . Diego Simeone (left) or Jurgen Klopp could be potential replacements for the City manager . Carlo Ancelotti is another that fits the bill if he was to leave current club Real Madrid at the end of the season . Two managers at less fashionable clubs, trying to fight with the big boys in their domestic league and in Europe. Or go for greatness itself – Carlo Ancelotti fits the bill, and so does the man we all expected the hierarchy at City to deliver – Pep Guardiola. When Sheik Mansour arrived at Manchester City he declared that he wanted the club to be winning in Europe. They're still not doing that, and it's about time City went to the next level, for their own good, and for the good of English football. It's like they poked their head out of United's shadow for a few seconds and got burned by the sunshine. Think big City, or forever stay small.","Manchester United 4-2 Manchester City: Click here to read the match report .

970,0ba1dc167831450187cb6bb7dc4da7ba18aea129,"Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. Etan's body was never found, nor was any trace of clothing or his belongings. He had never been considered a suspect - his name appears only once in law enforcement paperwork at the time Etan disappeared. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ. A teenage stock clerk at the corner shop, Hernandez knew there were children in and out of the store, and Etan had been there countless times, the prosecutor said. She said Hernandez saw Etan with a dollar and calculated he wanted a drink, so he asked him to the basement. 'Day after day he saw this beautiful little boy,' she said. 'One day, he acted on an impulse and did something terrible to this little boy.' She said the motive was sexual, and Etan likely fought back. 'The quickest and easiest way to shut him up and shut him up permanently was to choke him to death,' she said. Rosemary Hernandez, left, and Becky Hernandez, the wife and daughter of Pedro Hernandez, arrive for court in New York, on Wednesday . Stanley Patz, left, the father of Etan Patz, arrives for court on Wednesday, although his estranged wife Julie, right, hasn't been pictured at court in recent days . Illuzzi-Orbon said his first confession to a prayer group shortly after the boy disappeared was the most accurate - he was confessing to God, and he was trying to unburden himself. Prayer circle members testified that Hernandez made tearful admissions during a 1979 retreat that matched some of what he told authorities on video 33 years later: He gave a child a soda, took him to the store basement and choked him. Two said Hernandez also admitted abusing the boy; when talking to police, Hernandez denied molesting Etan. A former neighbor and his ex-wife also testified he told them about killing someone in New York. The Maple Shade, New Jersey, man made the stunning admissions to police after authorities received a tip from a relative who saw news reports of the case in 2012. Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'I grabbed him by the neck and started choking him,' said Hernandez, now 54. 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the confession video shows 'a man sitting there convinced he killed a child - on a day that he doesn't know, at a time he doesn't know, at a location near a bus stop that he doesn't know.' The defense has suggested that the real killer is a convicted pedophile jailed in Pennsylvania who was the longtime suspect in the case. That man, Jose Ramos, denies involvement. However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. 'Two confessions,' Fishbein said. 'Which person is more likely to have been a predator?' Etan's photo was one of the first on milk cartons. The day he went missing, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day.

Elsewhere, the list of places named after the Queen includes a city in South Australia, British and Australian Antarctica and Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is famous for its beauty and tree-climbing lions, in Uganda. Earlier this week, the Queen appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers as she cheered on her horse in the Royal Box at Newbury.

ISIS entered the Yarmouk camp as Jordan closed its only functioning border crossing with the country following heavy clashes on the Syrian side between rebels and government forces. The militants, who already control large swaths of territory in northern Syria, reportedly entered the camp from the nearby Hajar Aswad neighborhood in southern Damascus in a coordinated attack with their rivals in the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. According to the the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, ISIS managed to take control of large parts of the Yarmouk camp following clashes with a Palestinian group. Jihadis: ISIS militants (pictured) entered the Yarmouk camp as Jordan closed its only functioning border crossing with the country following heavy clashes on the Syrian side between rebels and government forces . If ISIS manage to gain full control of Yarmouk, the jihadis can potentially use the camp as a base from which to threaten the heart of the capital as possibly challenge Assad himself. The Palestinian-run refugee camp  has been under government siege for nearly two years. U.N. aid workers have been sending food parcels into the camp, where thousands of civilians remain trapped and in desperate need of food and medicine. The camp had witnessed fighting in the past between government forces and militants who control much of the camp. The Observatory reported heavy clashes in the camp between IS fighters and members of the Palestinian faction called Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis. Residents of the Palestinian-run Yarmouk camp are seen queuing to receive food supplies last year . Anwar Raja, the spokesman for the pro-Assad Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said ISIS fighters entered the camp from nearby Hajar Aswad where they have been based for months. He added that today's push came was coordinated between ISIS and their rivals in the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's branch in Syria. 'The Nusra Front opened the road for them in order to infiltrate the camp and several hours ago they entered Yarmouk,' Raja said by telephone. It was not immediately clear why Nusra - who have repeatedly fought against ISIS over the past year - would facilitate the entry of the group into the camp. A Syrian foreign ministry statement today said it holds Jordan responsible for 'obstructing the movement of trucks and passengers and any ensuing economic or social repercussions.' U.N relief workers with blue helmets and vests stand next of residents of the Yarmouk camp one year ago . Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said that the Nasib crossing was temporarily closed late last night because of clashes nearby. 'It is important for us to keep the safety for the passengers and those who are trying to cross between the two countries,' he said. 'So we decided to close the border temporarily, until things calm down. Then we will open it again.' A spokesman for rebels in southern Syria, Issam al-Rayess, confirmed that rebel fighters were trying to take control of the border crossing from Syrian authorities. The Nasib crossing is the only functioning crossing between Jordan and Syria and is considered a crucial gateway for Syria's government and for Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian traders and merchants. Gruesome new images have emerged showing Islamic State militants stoning a blindfolded and bound man and woman to death in Iraq after they were accused of having sex before marriage. Taken in the ISIS-stronghold of Mosul in Nineveh province, the shocking images show a large crowd gathered to watch the jihadis murder the defenceless couple. Young boys clamber onto their fathers' shoulders to get a better view of the man and woman being charged with 'fornication', before the familiar white-bearded face of ISIS's elderly Mosul-based executioner-in-chief Abu Ansar al-Ansari orders their stoning to death. The sickening images begin by showing a large crowd gathered in a rain-drenched square in central Mosul.

In the background of the image, women wearing black niqabs are seen gathered together. An Islamic State militant with a yellow scarf covering his face is then seen using a microphone and PA system to read out the charge of 'fornication' against the couple, suggesting they have been accused of having sex without being married, not of committing adultery. A large pile of stones are then seen heaped in the middle of the road, before the barbaric ISIS militants began throwing them at the defenceless and blindfolded couple, who have had their hands bound to prevent them getting away. As stones rain down on the victims' bodies, large pools of blood appear in the road, before eventually the man and woman die of their injuries and the savagery finally comes to an end.

Smoke: The submarine that caught fire in a shipyard was submerged to extinguish the blaze yesterday . Defence sources said the submarine's weapons and critical elements of its nuclear reactor had been removed before the fire broke out . The 500ft-long Oryol was in dock at Zvezdochka shipyard in Severodvinsk, 620 miles north of Moscow, on the White Sea. The submarine's dry dock was filled with water to put out the fire - a move taken after news agencies carried reports saying the emergency was already over. 'Preparation for filling the dry dock with water is underway,' said spokesman Ilya Zhitomirsky. 'The operation is necessary to extinguish the fire completely.' Filling the hull with foam to stop the flames spreading was 'not yielding results,' said a source. 'No workers or members of the crew were harmed during the fire,' said Zhitomirsky. A source told TASS news agency the submarine's nuclear reactor had been shut down prior to the blaze. 'The active zone of the reactor was unloaded at the start of repairs a few years ago,' the source said. Emergency: A submarine undergoes repairs at Zvezdochka shipyard in Severodvinsk in 2012. A nuclear submarine has caught fire at the naval base after welding set insulating material alight during repairs .

The news agency reports said the fire had started during welding, causing insulation materials to catch fire. A similar blaze in 2011 nearly led to a nuclear disaster when a blaze engulfed a nuclear-powered submarine carrying atomic weapons. A leading Russian magazine reported the threat months after the blaze, contradicting official assurances that it was not armed. The Oscar II-class submarine is capable of carrying nuclear-tipped cruise and anti-submarine missiles.","Officials insist there were no weapons on board and atomic reactor is safe .
