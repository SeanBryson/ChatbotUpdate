1516,f00ae3c3929d829cd469ba4f229cc613b0766203,"Comedian Jenny Eclair travelled with her other half on a Painting In Venus break with Flavours . There comes a time in a woman’s life when beach holidays just don’t cut it any longer, when lying on golden sands (unless you’re buried up to your neck) serves only to remind you how much weight you forgot to lose again this year and how ill-fitting your swimming costume is. Being control freaks, most fifty-something females find ‘doing nothing’ a bit boring – after all, there are only so many hours one can spend on a Kindle, and woman cannot live by fiction alone. This is the time when the ‘alternative holiday experience’ tickles your holiday tastebuds and you find yourself looking at brochures for Nordic cruises. Excellent! Everyone looks fat pointing at a fjord while wearing an Aran jumper. But apart from choosing chilly destinations such as the Arctic or Scarborough, your other non-lolling-about option is the ‘activity holiday’, which can range from Pilates to kayaking, or painting to pottery. Yes, I’ve crossed over: the world is divided into those who still want to ‘give it large’ in Ibiza, and those who want to find their ‘inner artist’. An excursion to Venice one day provided inspiration for the budding artists . I’m in the latter camp – and I’ve got the paintings to prove it. Over the past year, I have found enormous pleasure, not in shoe shops, but in the haberdashery department of Peter Jones, or any shop that supplies art materials. I’ve developed a yearning to be creative. I wanted to do something in my spare time that saved my sanity, lowered my blood pressure (without going to the gym), soothed my soul and, with any luck, provided some cheap Christmas presents. Cooking has never been my thing, I’m an enthusiastic but rubbish knitter, but I did do A-level Art, so I decided I fancied being taught how to master watercolours while simultaneously having a holiday somewhere nice. Bingo! Last autumn I found myself spending a week in Treviso, just outside Venice, with a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks. Now before I go any further, I have to warn any single ladies that if you’re looking for hanky-panky, the Italian painting/cooking holiday combo may not provide rich pickings. With the exception of the painting tutor, Scotsman Hugh, and my other half Geof, we were middle-aged women to the core. Fabulous, hilarious, slightly eccentric middle- aged, middle-class women with plenty of pashminas and photos of dogs on our iPhones! Jenny stayed at the Villa Bianchi, a comfortable farmhouse surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both Treviso and Venice . For seven days, we painters were patiently guided by Hugh through the basics of sketching, paint technique, colour and form, while the cooks stayed in the kitchen making our meals. I know who picked the short straw. But then, as they say, it’s horses for courses. The cooks wanted to chop vegetables into smithereens, while we artists wanted to sit in a medieval market town with a paintbrush in one hand and a glass of prosecco in the other. Of course, it wasn’t all work. Two days into the break, our holiday operator Flavours herded us all into minibuses and took us to Venice. Like schoolchildren with credit cards, we roamed the most beautiful city in the world and came home, inspired by its mind-boggling loveliness, with lots of photos to copy into our art books back at our base, Villa Bianchi. Staying in Treviso, just outside Venice, Jenny stayed in a nine-strong crew of wannabe artists and keen cooks . Although it was in the middle of nowhere, the farmhouse was comfortable, surrounded by maize fields and within easy striking distance by car of both Treviso and Venice. The grounds were meticulously kept and the garden featured a very attractive landscaped pool. Being the only couple, Geof and I had a separate annexe to ourselves. It might have looked a bit garage-like from the outside, but inside it was large and comfortable and contained a small kitchen (handy if the cooks in the main house aren’t up to scratch). Accommodation in the main villa was simple but stylish, whistle-clean, and with lots of bold splashes of colour and squishy sofas. Outside, a covered colonnaded area meant we could paint outdoors even when the weather turned. In terms of relaxation, the holiday ticked all the right boxes – Geof and I had a completely stress-free break, and other people did the cooking. How marvellous is that? There was no need to feel anxious about restaurant bills as the food and drink were entirely inclusive, even when went out on day trips to Venice and Treviso. As for our artistic endeavours, Geof cheated, having been at art school in the 1960s. Heavenly backdrop: Church of Santa Maria Della Salute at dusk, Venice, just one of the Venetian sights that provided inspiration in the historic city . He quickly became the teacher’s pet, which was slightly infuriating (although secretly I was rather proud of him). And me? Well, I definitely found my inner artist. Unfortunately she’s a bit gaudy and rather heavy-handed on the colour front, but if you like your paintings slightly vulgar, then I’m happy to take commissions (prices on application). So, well done to Flavours. Thanks to you, a ratty, tired old couple came home with a some rather special holiday memories. Now, I’m not saying that any of mine are going on the wall, but a couple of Geof’s might make it into frames. In the meantime, I’m still doing it. My palette, brushes and delicious selection of multi-coloured pans (the little blocks of paint) are always to hand. I love the ritual of it. I like the way my breathing slows down when I have a brush in my hand. I might not be very good at painting but painting is very good for me.

The federal government will give Shoshana Hebshi $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks after armed agents forced her from a plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, made her undress during a search and held her for hours.

Won her case: Shoshana Hebshi, of Sylvania, Ohio, who was strip-searched at a Detroit-area airport, will gain $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated . Yoga instructor: Hebshi works as a freelance writer, yoga instructor, and is a mother to two twins . Hebshi, who has a Jewish mother and Saudi Arabian father, has said she was ethnically profiled based on her dark complexion. 'I filed this lawsuit because I didn't want others to experience the kind of unnecessary trauma that I did, and it has given me faith that the justice system can work to protect constitutional rights,' Hebshi said in a release. 'This settlement gives me some peace of mind. Now, I feel like I can finally put the incident behind me.' Hebshi of Sylvania, Ohio, was traveling home after visiting a sister in California when was removed from the Frontier Airlines flight after it landed Sept. 11, 2011. She was seated next to two Indian-American men, whom crew members had said spent a lot of time in the plane's bathroom. All three were detained, according to the ACLU.

Airport police 'acted quickly and responsibly, and followed appropriate protocols in responding to a request for help from one of our airline partners,' Authority Chief Executive Thomas Naughton said in a release. 'I strongly support their actions. We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.' As part of the settlement, Frontier will amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and provide all new employees with training on that revision. The airline also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given appropriate attention. Frontier Airlines declined to comment on the settlement. According to Hebshi's Twiiter, she is a mother of twin boys and works as a yoga instructor and freelance writer.

Djokovic lost his cool at the end of the second set as Murray came back to take the match to a decider but has since expressed his regret at the incident in a video posted on Facebook. During the rant, Djokovic snatched a towel from the shocked youngster before umpire Damien Dumusois gave him a code violation for the outburst, saying it 'didn't look good' as he sat down between the change of ends. Novak Djokovic issued an apology via Facebook to a ball boy he frightened during the Miami Open . Djokovic shouted at his backroom team after he lost the second set of the final to Andy Murray . The world No 1 grabbed a towel from the ball boy (right)  who seemed startled by the loud confrontation . He said: 'It's probably been the best start to a season aside from 2011 that I had in my career, and I can't be more grateful for all the support I'm getting from you guys and I'm enjoying my time playing and competing and hopefully I brought a smile to your faces. 'Also I want to reflect on a bad moment that happened in the final against Andy when I lost the second set. I yelled to my camp and my box in frustration. 'I saw the replay. Unfortunately a ball boy was in the middle of it and I really, really feel sorry and regret that he was there. There was absolutely no intention whatsoever to hurt him or scare him in any kind of way. I sincerely hope he forgives me. I really apologise.' Djokovic then extended his apology to the boy's parents. 'I do care about children a lot right now and I look at it in a much different way,' he added. 'So I want to apologise to his parents for this situation as well. As a father I wouldn't wish that something like this happens to my son. The youngster was standing between Djokovic and his backroom team during the heated exchange . 'Again I sincerely hope you can forgive me and that we can move on. Unfortunately sometimes the emotions get the better of you. 'Also times as a professional athlete you learn how to control them and how to stay composed and mentally strong. But on a hot day like this when Andy was playing well and pushing all my buttons it wasn't easy.' Djokovic was feeling the pressure after Murray fought back from a first set tie-break loss to win the second set in the blazing heat of Key Biscayne, Florida. But the outburst seemed to take Djokovic to another level as he rolled Murray 6-0 in the third to claim his fifth Miami Open title.

11457,c05bda9b387ec8ae43803170b6f59b4b82505db9,"(CNN)ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis, a minority group whose members were killed, captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer, officials said. Most of those released were women and children; the rest were ill or elderly, said Rassol Omar, a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends  northern Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Omar didn't say what led to the release, other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it. The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga, who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital, Irbil, said Nuri Osman, an official with Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government. It wasn't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday's release, Osman said. Osman said 217 Yazidis were released. Omar, the Peshmerga commander, had a higher count: 228. ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group's towns last year. The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq's north last summer, forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes. Yazidis are of Kurdish descent, and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. One of the oldest religious communities in the world, the Yazidis have long suffered persecution, with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers. ISIS' cruelty to them has been extraordinary. ISIS' conquest of the town of Sinjar, in particular, provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria. ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds, Yian Dakhil, the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq's Parliament, told CNN last year. Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives. An international coalition responded, first by airdropping supplies in the mountains. Rescues came next. And then, starting in August, the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq, accounting for less than 1% of the country's population. CNN's Raja Razek reported from Beirut. CNN's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Hamdi Alkshali, Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.","Most of those released were women and children .

647,5c7493c6f28cfd58aa7b5f0e486e611307b4126d,"Hillary Clinton’s security detail arrived at a suburban Des Moines, Iowa fruit processing company on Tuesday with an added vehicle – a second Scooby. After her signature oversize black Chevy conversion van dropped her off at Capitol Fruit Company in Norwalk, Iowa, a visually identical GMC van drove up to the building with a nearly identical Secret Service escort vehicle. Both armored vehicles have raised roofs, deep-tinted windows and New York license plates. But while the original van – the one nicknamed 'Scooby' after the Scooby-Doo cartoon show – sports a mustard-yellow New York tag, the second has blue and white plates of a different design. Scroll down for video . WHY BUY ONE WHEN YOU CAN HAVE TWO AT TWICE THE PRICE? The first picture of both of Hillary Clinton's Scooby mobiles. One is a GMC and the other is a Chevrolet, but they are mechanically identical . CONVOY: Scooby-one and Scooby-two took up positions in Hillary's motorcade on a freeway near Des Moines . BACK SEAT DRIVER? Hillary Clinton climbs into the so-called Scooby van after a campaign stop at Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa . Clinton (right), a Democratic presidential hopeful and former secretary of state, posed for selfies with fans after meeting with members of the Iowa State legislature at the State Capital on Wednesday . It’s common for U.S. Secret Service to employ 'decoy' vehicles, identical in design, in order to inject some mystery into VIPs' travel plans, if for no other reason than to confuse and discourage would-be attackers. When President Barack Obama returns to the White House after long trips, his arrival on the Marine One helicopter can be a shell-game exercise when three identical choppers appear on the horizon. Only one, of course, lands on the South Lawn. A Secret Service spokesperson said the agency does not comment on security arrangements for dignitaries. FLASHERS: 'Scooby-two' forced an Iowa motorist to leave the roadway on Wednesday so it could go through a red light and rejoin the caravan . Mrs. Clinton enjoys constant protection at taxpayers' expense because she is part of a former first family, not as a result of her service in the U.S. Senate or the State Department. But at some point during presidential campaigns, front-runner status generally attracts Secret Service as a candidate’s profile is elevated and crowd sizes swell. On Wednesday, the two Scooby vans arrived at Clinton's appointed location separately, but left together in a seven-car motorcade. UNDER GUARD: Two Secret Service agents with Scooby One in Iowa today . MOTORCADE: The Clinton convoy includes both Scooby vans and four black Suburbans, believed to all be Secret Service vehicles. It also included a white minivan on Wednesday . Scooby-Two’s driver brought up the rear, at enough of a distance to allow another car to pull in front of him. When that car stopped at a red light, the GMC van’s blue and red flashing lights came on. The stray car’s driver pulled to one side and Scooby-Two zoomed into the intersection, against the light . DECOYS: The Secret Service frequently deploys duplicates of aircraft and cars it uses to transport VIPs – including Marine One, the president's customized helicopter, which usually travels with two decoys .","Second modified, armored van spotted near Des Moines, Iowa alongside the one that Hillary Clinton travels in .

Pharoah saw the funny side of the incident and shared viewers’ tweets about the blunder on his own account. ‘The Project just played a a few clips for upcoming guest Michael Che and 2 of the clips were of Jay Pharoah #AWKWARD,’ tweeted Prue Knox. ‘Hey The Project, you do know that Michael Che and Jay Pharoah are two different people yeah? #ouch,’ Susan Bong tweeted, accompanied with a video of the gaffe.

10699,4dc06ca396df68b214798dc92c31808ab0dcb87a,"Steven Gerrard's hopes of a fairytale ending to his Liverpool career were shattered as his side suffered a 2-1 defeat to Aston Villa in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The final on May 30, also by coincidence Gerrard's 35th birthday, would have been the midfielder's final game in a Liverpool shirt before he leaves for the Los Angeles Galaxy in the summer, but - although he was handed a starting role by manager Brendan Rodgers - he was unable to influence the outcome. Here, Sportsmail takes a closer look at Gerrard's performance at Wembley. Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard (left) competes for posession with Kieran Richardson . ROLE . Gerrard started the game in an advanced role behind Raheem Sterling and to the right of Philippe Coutinho in a 3-4-2-1 formation but midway through the first half, Liverpool adjusted their shape to 4-4-1-1, pushing Coutinho wide left and allowing Gerrard to adopt a more central position behind the striker. Rodgers tweaked Liverpool, and Gerrard's, shape for a third time at the interval, as the Reds went 4-3-2-1 with Gerrard playing deepest of the midfield three. Gerrard controls possession under pressure from Villa's Ashley Westwood at Wembley . Gerrard almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared off the line . POSSESSION . The first half largely passed Gerrard by as playing further forward starved him of any sustained spells of possession and Villa crowded out the space in front of their back four to good effect. Dropping back into central midfield after the interval allowed the Liverpool captain to collect the ball from his defenders but his passing was cautious and occasionally wayward. Gerrard was deployed in a number of different roles by Brendan Rodgers (right) throughout the contest . GOAL THREAT . Gerrard blazed a long-range effort over the bar shortly after half-time and curled a potentially dangerous free-kick into the hands of Shay Given midway through the second half. He almost snatched a dramatic equaliser with four minutes left, but his header was cleared off the line. OVERALL . This was far from the fairytale ending Gerrard would have hoped for. The veteran looked confused by the various roles given to him by Rodgers and he failed to thrive in any of them.

6098,b39341c062db854a18fefb0f100976103705a086,"Just weeks after he controversially banned meat products from being sold at the Sydney Opera House during his upcoming shows there, Morrissey has once again weighed into Australian animal rights issues. The singer, who will be performing four sold-out shows as part of the Sydney Vivid Live festival in May, has written a public letter to The Just Group imploring them to cease their use of angora wool. The Australian retail giant, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur. Warning: graphic content . New campaign: Morrissey has written a letter to Australian retailer The Just Group imploring them to stop the use of angora wool . Brutal: PETA have successfully petitioned a number of Australian and international retailers to stop selling angora wool after revealing the horrific treatment of rabbits at Chinese angora farms . PETA Australia has been petitioning The Just Group to reconsider their position after successfully getting other retailers, including David Jones, Myer, Sportsgirl, General Pants Co, and Jeanswest, to stop selling angora. 'I'm looking forward to my concerts at the Sydney Opera House in May, but I was extremely dismayed to learn from my friends at PETA Australia that The Just Group refuse to modernise and drop angora wool from their clothing lines', Morrissey writes. 'By selling angora wool, you're sending the message to millions of shoppers that your company condone the barbaric abuse and slaughter of rabbits and are willing to perpetuate it.' Refusal: The Just Group, who own Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jacqui E, and Jay Jays, have so far refused to back down on their stance in using the controversial fur . Stance: The retailer has previously issued a statement on the controversy, simply saying: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group' The singer, 55, added that he would post petitions for concertgoers to sign at information booths throughout the Opera House if the company did not reverse their decision. Globally, major fashion chains including Zara, H&M, Marks & Spencer, and Gap have all pledged to not use the fur in recent years after PETA outed the heartbreaking conditions of angora rabbits. The organisation revealed the treatment of rabbits on angora farms in China, where workers rip the fur from live rabbits' skin. PETA alleges that the rabbits 'scream in pain' during the process. The Just Group are yet to respond to Daily Mail Australia's request for comment, however a spokesperson has previously responded to PETA with the statement: 'Although we are not able to join the pledge sought, I want to thank you for your interest in our group.' In February, Morrissey made headline when he ordered all food and bar outlets linked to the Opera House's Concert Hall remove meat products from their menus for the duration of his residency. Additionally, the former Smiths singer, who has been a non-meat eater since the age of 11, ordered that only vegetarian food be served backstage at the venue. Protest: Morrissey, 55, pledged to set up petition booths for attendees at his Sydney concerts to sign if The Just Group do not comply . The  Irish-born star, who says he sees 'no difference' between eating animals and paedophilia, they are both rape, violence, murder, -  will take to the stage during the festival of light and music on the 26th, 27th, 30th and 31st of May. Morrissey has never been shy about his views on meat eaters and has categorically said 'If I'm introduced to anyone who eats beings, I walk away.' He briefly walked off-stage at Coachella in 2009, complaining about the smell from the nearby food concession area, saying 'The smell of burning animals is making me sick'. Last month he banned burgers and hot dogs from Belfast's the Odyssey Arena for his performance. And he recently ditched a scheduled concert in Iceland when the venue refused to grant his no meat requests the night of his gig. In concert: The Irish-born musician has also banned the sale of meat products at the Opera House for the duration of his residency for the Vivid festival in May . Last year, during a Q&A session on his fan site, True To You, he replied to a groupie's question saying: 'I see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia... 'Imagine, for example, if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you ""Hello, I enjoy bloodshed, throat-slitting and the destruction of life,"" well, I doubt if you'd want to exchange phone numbers.' In another post, he wrote of TV chef Jamie Oliver: 'If Jamie 'Orrible is so certain that flesh-food is tasty then why doesn't he stick one of his children in a microwave?' The animal activist is equally known for his outspoken political views and hatred of the British monarchy. He once said in an outspoken interview in 1984 of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher: 'She is only one person. She can be destroyed. It is the only remedy for this country at the moment.' British police responded by searching Morrissey's home and carrying out an official investigation. Daily Mail Australia have contacted The Just Group for comment.","Morrissey wrote a letter to Australian retailer The Just Group .

The tune, which sounds somewhat like an 80s rock ballad actually translates as 'I will fight for the Fillipino' and will be played ahead of the richest fight in history against the undefeated American at the MGM Grand on May 2. Multi-talented Pacquiao not only wrote and sang the tune but also directed the music video . The video also carries a nostalgic feel, featuring a leather-clad Pacquiao crooning into the microphone Band-Aid style while a montage of his various fights and humanitarian efforts fade in and out. Whether Mayweather has called on his close friend and cheerleader Justin Bieber to come up with his own entrance song has not been confirmed. The boxing champion's song 'Lalaban Ako Para Sa Filipino' translates as 'I will fight for the Fillipino' The 80s style music video includes a montage of Pacquiao's fights and his humanitarian efforts . Meanwhile, the 36-year-old decided to train on the streets of Los Angeles on Friday as he ran along the trail at Griffith Park joined by several fitness fanatics. As well as working on his aerobic endurance, Pacquiao was also tested on his core strength and showed off his impressive footwork in front of watching spectators by shadow boxing. Pacquiao recently unveiled the multicoloured mouth guard he will wear during his $300million Las Vegas showdown with Mayweather. The container that it comes in reads 'MouthGuards for Champions', demonstrating Pacquiao's undoubted confidence. Pacquiao was joined by his dog Pacman as he ran around one of North America's largest urban parks . Pacquiao has revealed the colourful mouthpiece he will wear during the May 2 bout in Las Vegas . I always ask in my mind why do we have to judge what you feel? What should be the right basis so they can listen to us? Do we have to be in a good status? Even if i hurt myself, i still wanted to keep it within me and just be silent about it. Even if my heart aches, its nothing to me as long as people from my country show their smiles and felt happy. I will fight the whole world for my country bringing your name . I'm a Pinoy. We are Pinoy . I will fight the world with my life at stake. I will fight for all Filipino . Even us, has our own dreams for our country . To help fellow countrymen, and give pride for our very own country . It doesn't matter who you are. Poor or rich if for the country we all fight together. I will fight the whole world for my country bringing your name . I'm a Pinoy. We are Pinoy. I will fight the world with my life at stake. I will fight for all Filipino . I will fight, I will fight . I will fight the whole world for my country bringing your name . I'm a Pinoy. We are Pinoy. I will fight the world with my life at stake.

1683,131effae07cdb7ebc21527fe7def467c38e02b0a,"Sitting with a set of felt-tip pens and a book full of black line drawings just waiting to be filled is most children's idea of heaven. But now thanks to an illustrator and designer from Tenby, West Wales, colouring in is the latest stress-busting hobby for adults. Millie Marotta, 36, is giving colouring books an adult twist with her sellout volume Animal Kingdom, filled with intricate and designs of animals filled with stylised flower shapes, patterns and shapes. Scroll down for video . Embellished elephant: Millie Marotta's colouring book features an array of intricate designs, including this elephant . Millie Marotta, 36, took eight months to complete the illustration in Animal Kingdom . The beautiful black and white book is made up of detailed line illustrations of animals, plants and birds and encourages users to 'add your own touches with colours or line drawing.' And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book. 'This is why I would say they are so well suited to adults and have proved so popular in that area of the market.' This coloured-in image of a dragonfly taken out of Animal Kingdom shows the vibrant level of detail . An image of a donkey from the colouring book is creatively constructed from flora and fauna . Millie has had a successful freelance illustration careeer with clients including Virgin Atlantic, Penguin books and Marks & Spencer, but it's her best-selling colouring book that really propelled her to fame. In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world. A bluebird illustration has been coloured in to show the creativity and consistency needed to finish one of Millie's illustrations . This blue whale has an immense level of detail and would take a considerable amount of time to finish colouring in . Millie worked from her studio in Tenby, Wales, to create her range of detailed illustrations . 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world and those things which may be causing us worry or stress. A little bit of escapism if you like.' And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic . The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at £3.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list . The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings . Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations . She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'","Millie Marotta's book, Animal Kingdom, features detailed line illustrations .

6676,5de4dd6f1c851137f0362f81cf67da88e389c935,"An artist with a penchant for snapping urban architecture has come up with an innovative new way of making the most of his photography. French photographer and illustrator, Thomas Lamadieu, takes snaps of the sky in courtyards and built-up areas to create a frame of buildings. The space in between then acts as a canvas for his playful illustrations which he has dubbed 'sky art'. On his website Thomas says that his artistic aim is to 'show a different perception of urban architecture and the everyday environment around us, what we can construct with a boundless imagination'. Before and after: Lamadieu's original  shot (left) and after it is transformed into 'sky art' (right) Lamadieu, who is also known as Roots Art, is based in France but travels the world to photograph the space between buildings in various cities. In the past year alone he has visited Belgium, Germany, Canada, the United States and South Korea in his quest to find the perfect sky canvases for his illustrations. Since he began creating sky art in 2011,  Lamadieu has made a name for himself among critics, art lovers and journalists all around the world. Speaking to the Independent, Lamadieu said: 'The sky drawings series really started with as a way of playing with my imagination to show how these seemingly empty spaces in the urban environment could be reinterpreted in different and creative ways.' 'The bearded man in my images stands for the sky itself, the big man in the sky, but it’s not meant to be religious in any way'. Surreal: Three characters draw their own illustrations in an inverted sky shot . Upside down: A bearded figure rides a cat in between the buildings . Peace out: An illustration of a man playing an electric guitar fills the sky space in this photograph . Cheshire cat: A drawing of a couple embracing behind a grinning cat fills the gap where the sky would have originally been . Using a fish-eye lens camera to capture the perfect vertical shot, Thomas Lamadieu then illustrates the graphic shape created between buildings using Microsoft Paint. These abstract canvases depict a collection of humorous characters and surreal scenes. One inverted upshot depicts three bearded men drawing a picture of the night sky; meanwhile another shows a woman with hair not dissimilar to that of Marge Simpson reclining between two buildings. Self portrait? A man spray painting clouds on a canvas fills the skyscape in this photograph taken in a courtyard . Twit twoo: A black and white illustration of an owl looks down upon this oval shaped void . Thumbs up: An image of a man holding a Polaroid of a smiling cloud is superimposed onto a shot of town houses . A signature Lamadieu figure appears to be a bearded man in a Breton striped top who features in various guises throughout the 'sky art' images. In one picture he appears as a giant rock star wielding an electric guitar, and in another he has a camera around his neck whilst presenting a Polaroid of a cloud. As well as surrealism, optical illusion is also a key theme in Lamadieu's work - these confusing images combining photography with clever illustration are certainly hard to get your head around. Jack in the box: An illustration of a masked man holding a Jack in the box toy overlooks this snap between two brick buildings and a washing line . Optical illusion: This sky shot has been transformed into a clever optical illusion thanks to Lamadieu's illustration . One image that plays a trick on the eye is a vertical sky photograph combined with a horizontal illustration of a game of cat and mouse to mind-boggling affect. Similarly, an image of a bearded man in a striped top holding some cloud shaped balloons creates a trompe l'oeil that the facade of the building is a pavement with illustrated figures superimposed on it. Meanwhile, the sky becomes the sea in another illustrated image of a man on a boat surrounded by circling sharks. Trompe l'oeil: It's difficult to tell which way is up thanks to this clever and confusing illustration . Sea-ing double: The distorted angle of this photo combined with sea illustration make it a mind-bending photo to look at .

De Gea has been in fantastic form this season, while Real's legendary stopper Iker Casillas has long been seen as unreliable. Although the European champions would like to sign De Gea this June, they are looking at the possibility of picking up Chelsea's Petr Cech to fill the gap in between, while the Spaniard runs down his contract at Old Trafford, which expires next year. Real Madrid's attempt to nab David De Gea is the big story in AS, while Marca focus on James Rodriguez . In a move that Spanish paper AS calls 'Operation De Gea', the paper claims Real are only prepared to pay for the keeper if United 'fix a reasonable price' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year. De Gea's contract is up at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016, and he is yet to sign a new deal, with United still uncertain of Champions League football for next season. Cech, meanwhile, looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Czech keeper likely to command a fee of around £10million. Elsewhere in Spain the focus is on Lionel Messi's injury, which is still causing him some problems ahead of Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo on Sunday. Sport say 'Messi is OK', with the news that 'all tests were positive' on his injured foot, and Marca add that the Barca star has 'overcome the pain'. Lionel Messi's injury dominates in Sport, while in Italy there is more news on Palermo's Paulo Dybala . However, the Madrid-based paper also report that 'he still can’t put his boot on' because of the injury to his metatarsal. There is better news for James Rodriguez, who is also set to return from injury, with Marca reporting that he will start for Real Madrid on Sunday, his first game for 59 days. In Italy there are reports that Palermo striker Paulo Dybala, who has been linked with Arsenal, could join up with former Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini at Inter Milan. Corriere dello Sport reports that Inter are ready to offer £22million for the Argetinian youngster.","David De Gea is yet to extend his contract beyond 2016 .

But now Bon Apetit has come up with a genius way to revive your stale loaf and it involves running it under the tap. And whilst it might sound like an unusual move, they promise that this trick will revive your crusty old bread before dinner time. Bon Apetit have revealed that the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread is to run it under water before baking it in the oven . The first step they suggest is to take your stale bread and run it under your tap. It doesn't matter if the water is hot or cold but you should try to keep the cut edge away from the direct flow of water. Then turn your oven on to a warm temperature - around 150 degrees - and stick the bread inside. For a small loaf you need to allow around 6-7 minutes and for a large, or particularly wet one, around 12 to 13 minutes. The experts say it works because: 'The water turns to steam, which rehydrates the bread’s crumb, or interior, while the heat of the oven firms up the crust.' When you have wet your bread put it in the oven for between 6 and 13 minutes depending on how large and how wet the loaf is . Femail spoke to Lifesum nutritionist Luvisa Nilsson who said that the water trick does actually work, but you must make sure to eat the bread that same day. 'Whilst there might not be any obvious health risks whilst using the water/heat method, it is beneficial not to waste food,' she said.' 'Once you have put your ‘watered’ bread in the oven or microwave, make sure you eat it within the day, as the warmth and damp may potentially harbour bacteria. Nutritionist Luvisa Nillson says that you should be careful to check that your bread is not mouldy and make sure to eat it within one day . She continued: 'There is however a difference between stale and mouldy bread, and you must watch out for mould. 'Bread should be disposed off if it has orange, green, yellow or black spots as these can be harmful to your gut and cause severe discomfort and stomach ache. 'When bread goes stale it is usually a good sign that It is about to go mouldy, so give the bread a thorough check before consuming.'","Bon Apetit have revealed the best way to revive a stale loaf of bread .

7516,596bced0d8ee1c0ceb6bddaa5cbb1f3dcd98ce3e,"Samantha says she thinks she's 'fabulous' I sprung out of bed this morning and examined myself in the full-length bedroom mirror, and I can honestly say that there’s never a day when I would rather be someone else. The woman looking back at me? She’s gorgeous, intelligent and fabulous! Quite simply, I adore who I am – inside and out. I’m no narcissist – I’m perfectly aware I have flaws, but they’re deliciously wrapped up in the very unique moi. I’ve grown to love my nose that tilts ever so slightly to the right, my hourglass figure that boasts slightly-too-large hips, and my green-sometimes-grey eyes. I’m a size 10, but even so I could do with dropping 10lbs. But as long as I don’t mind, who cares? Which is why I’m utterly peeved about Dove's latest campaign results. How humiliating to film women in a public place ‘choosing’ to walk through a door marked either ‘beautiful’ or ‘average’. Talk about putting the meeker sex on the spot. It's hardly a big surprise the survey discovered 96 per cent of women chose the 'average' option. From my experience, most women would rather strut out in public as naked as the day they were born than  freely admit that not only are they good-looking, but they’re also (whisper it) beautiful. Why is this? Numerous university studies have been carried out (I know this because their authors send them to me) and they have all come up with the same conclusion – it’s self-protection. If women don’t fit in with their (usually older, fatter, less attractive) female peers, then those who are good-looking won’t get hired for jobs by the fairer sex; their careers will stall if their boss is female and they’ll routinely receive their P45 for nothing more heinous than boasting a lovely smile. And this is what really exasperates me: it isn’t society that won’t let us admit that we’re beautiful – it’s the very same members of our own sex who hold us back. Even though I’m an un-Botoxed, un-surgically enhanced 44-year-old, I would have marched through the entrance marked beautiful without giving it a second thought. I’m extremely comfortable in my skin. Haters: Samantha has received death threats for standing up and saying 'I'm beautiful' This confidence annoys the heck out of other women. You might have read what I’ve written about this problem, in an article published in April 2012. It received almost 5,000 comments online and suddenly I was a global name. The earth turned on its axis as one woman - me - was up for admitting: ‘I like how I look and other women have a problem with it.’ Since then I’ve been ridiculed, received death threats, told I’m off my rocker. Just last week I received yet another email from a woman titled ‘please read me’ which went on at length to tell me I was ‘an arrogant, cocky woman’. Little wonder only four per cent of women were brave enough to walk through a door marked 'beautiful' in the Dove campaign. Critical: Samantha claims Dove's campaign works because it exploits our need to act modestly . My personal take on this experiment is devastatingly simple: we’d rather fit in and humiliate ourselves by claiming to be average than give our fellow 'fairer' sex any more ammunition than we've got already against each other. My view is supported by the thousands of emails I’ve received over the years from women routinely humiliated, bullied and singled out by their female peers for daring to think they look good. The emails depressingly cover the same ground wherever they live in the world. Whether they’re teenagers at school in the US, middle-aged mums in Australia or women in the workplace in the UK: if they rate themselves, display confidence, or dare to say they look good they get bullied or socially ostracised. A recent plea from a young women in how to deal with her critics was this: . ‘I have just looked up your article, it’s my life in black and white. I tried dressing down, not wearing too much make up, unfashionable clothes and flat shoes. Reaching out: Samantha receives letters from teens who get bullied for being beautiful . 'I am confident and friendly, men open doors for me, they are polite. But some women are awful to me as a result of it. 'I am fed up with it, angry about it, annoyed with it. I feel like a complete nothing and nobody; maybe that’s what I should be to be accepted.’ Another woman was banned by her mean-minded (older) female boss for wearing heels to work: they were a ‘health hazard’. What health and safety offense could she cause wearing stilettos while working as a receptionist? The mind boggles. How awful that these women are treated this way. It's little wonder so many of the fairer sex refuse to acknowledge that they are good-looking, which is ironic because so many do it in private – behind the anonymity of social media. We know how to photograph ourselves well thanks to selfies and social media sites such as Instagram. We can iron out wrinkles, banish zits, magically award ourselves a thigh gap or hip dip. In the Dove campaign, women were asked to choose between a door marked 'beautiful' or 'average' Yet to admit to the world ‘yeah, I look good’ means we risk incurring the wrath of other women. We have to be display modesty at all times - which is why Dove's campaign works brilliantly. I’m not some superior Type A female who doesn’t recognise that there are some who don’t feel happy about themselves. Yet such feelings of low self-esteem seem to go hand in hand with the desire to criticise and target others in order to restore an illusion of self worth. Any female trolls ousted usually blame their behaviour on a crisis of confidence. Ironically, they are the only ones who can help themselves - but picking on others isn't the way to go about it. In 2015, we desperately need a seismic shift in female societal thinking so that women can say loud and proud that they’re beautiful - and not fear reprisals. Otherwise cynical advertising campaigns - in a bid to flog toiletries - will continue to exploit us just like this one has 'beautifully' done.","Author of 'Why women hate me for being beautiful' article speaks out .

7834,31a8ee43766fdfdd0784f398dd970280a5d58537,"A student has become an online sensation after powering his Cambridge college to glory in the final of University Challenge. Ted Loveday managed to answer 10 starter questions in the last round of the BBC quiz show, helping Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge defeat Magdalen College, Oxford. Viewers were astounded by his general knowledge prowess - but the law student has now admitted that he had help from some unlikely sources. Scroll down for video . Star: Ted Loveday has powered Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to victory in University Challenge . Mr Loveday revealed after his team's triumph that they had revised for the programme by watching YouTube videos and researching possible questions on Wikipedia. Gonville and Caius won the University Challenge title by amassing 225 points against Magdalen in the final, broadcast on BBC Two on Monday night. The team's victory was largely thanks to Mr Loveday, who provided the correct response to 10 'starter for 10' questions posed by presenter Jeremy Paxman. His range of expert topics ranged from foreign languages to economics and politics, via science and classical music. In the wake of the team's win, University Challenge viewers took to the internet to express their admiration for Mr Loveday - and the cable-knit jumpers he sported on screen. Team: The Cambridge students thrashed their opponents from Magdalen College, Cambridge . Quizmaster: The BBC Two show is hosted by Jeremy Paxman, notorious for his aggressive putdowns . 1) 'This long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we're all dead.' These are the words of which economist? 2) 'They illustrate the temper of a pre-revolutionary age, when there is widespread desire for moderate reform.' These words of Bertrand Russell refer to which two figures of the northern Renaissance born respectively in London and Rotterdam? 3) What five-letter word means a stupid or silly woman in Mexican Spanish, a university canteen in German and in the English-speaking world an organisation founded in 1946 for people with high IQs? 4) During the 20th century, which Conservative Prime Minister's cabinet included that party's previous and subsequent Prime Ministers, both of whom served for the whole of its period in office, the former as Foreign Secretary and the latter as Secretary of State for Education? 5) 'The first known instance of the application of algorithmic thinking to a field outside logic and mathematics.' These words refer to a grammar of which language by the Gandharian scholar Panini? 6) Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter is an autobiographical work by which French author? It recounts her stifling and respectable upbringing and how she revolted against it at the Sorbonne with Jean-Paul Sartre. 7) Inspired by the artworks of Viktor Hartmann, 'The Gnome', 'The Hut on Fowl's Legs' and 'The Great Gate of Kiev' are among the 10 movements that comprise which suite by Mussorgsky? 8) John F Kennedy's statement that 'mankind must put an end to war or war will put an end to mankind' is an example of what figure of speech named after the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet? 9) From the Greek for 'unguent', what five-letter term denotes a complex of molten silicates with water and gases formed within the upper mantle of the earth? 10) Meaning 'said only once', what two-word Greek term denotes a word or word-form that is recorded only once in a text, in the work of a particular author, or in a body of literature? Scroll down to see the answers . Matt Stephens wrote on Twitter, 'Cable-knit jumper in excelsis,' while Jack Clayton added: 'After that performance, Loveday is going to be fighting off the groupies with a trident.' Paul Coxon, a Cambridge physicist, made a reference to the contestant's constant sips of water, joking: 'Loveday needs to drink so much water because he IS ON FIRE.' Mr Loveday even made an appearance on a blog called 'University Challenge Cuties', which said he was 'the definition of a UC cutie'. Speaking after his team's victory, Mr Loveday revealed that he had used the internet to finesse his quizzing skills ahead of filming - and suggested that University Challenge is not as intellectual as it might seem. 'We'd put aside regular times to sit down together in the college bar, watch past episodes on YouTube and try to shout the answers at the telly before any of the contestants buzzed,' he told the Gonville and Caius website. That was really helpful for improving our reaction speeds. 'Sometimes question-setters really like a particular area and they'll keep coming back to it. For instance, they're a bit obsessed with Pre-Raphaelite paintings, so we binged on some Wikipedia articles to make sure we were familiar with them. It paid off because we had a whole picture round on the Pre-Raphaelites! 'University Challenge isn't about deep understanding - it's about very wide, superficial knowledge combined with quick recall.' He also revealed that Jeremy Paxman treats the show's contestants generously despite his fierce reputation - Mr Loveday said: 'He knows you're just students and doesn't expect you to be as tough as the politicians he interviews. 'Having said that, he can be needlessly harsh in his put-downs to losing teams.' The quiz champion offered some advice for other students hoping to follow in his footsteps, saying that the key to success is simply watching the show and looking up the answers when necessary. 'I know some of the questions on the show can seem fairly intimidating and high-brow,' he said. 'But there's no magic secret to it - all the answers will be out there on Wikipedia somewhere. 'If you find a question daunting, look it up online and read about the answer. Next time it comes up, it won't be daunting any more.' Mr Loveday grew up in west London and went to Latymer Upper School, a leading private school in Hammersmith. This year was not the first time he tried to appear on University Challenge - last year he applied for the Gonville and Caius team, but did not make the cut. He follows in the footsteps of other notable champions such as Gail Trimble, who impressed even Mr Paxman when she captained Corpus Christi College, Oxford in 2009. Almost: Stephen Fry came second in the 1980 edition of University Challenge with Queens' College, Cambridge . For many University Challenge contestants, winning the show is a prelude to a successful career. But an unlucky few never reach the same heights again, and end up unable to make the most of their talents - or worse. Tony Gillham, who won the show in 2003 as a member of the Birkbeck College team, struggled with alcoholism after his victory. He said that he was even drunk while competing in the quiz - and suggested that winning was a poisoned chalice, because it convinced him that he could function properly despite his drinking. John Burke, a champion in 1999, ended up working as a postman despite his intellectual firepower. Six years ago he told a documentary: 'I'm certainly capable of a lot more than just delivering bits of paper. I've got a lot of other capabilities and I'm not really fulfilling my potential.' Champions to have found success after their University Challenge days include Kwasi Kwarteng and David Lidington, both Conservative MPs, who each won the contest while studying at Cambridge. Comedian Stephen Fry came close to joining their ranks in the quiz elite when he was part of the Queens' College, Cambridge team which came second in 1980. THE ANSWERS: 1) John Maynard Keynes; 2) Erasmus and Thomas More; 3) Mensa; 4) Ted Heath; 5) Sanskrit; 6) Simone de Beauvoir; 7) Pictures of an Exhibition; 8) Chiasmus; 9) Magma; 10) Hapax legomenon .","Ted Loveday led Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge to the University Challenge title this week .

And now Cheryl Prudham, a pregnant mother of 11, is blowing some of that cash on a £10,000 trip to Las Vegas, it was reported yesterday. The 33-year-old is said to be planning to renew her wedding vows with her husband Robert, 30, during the ‘no expense spared’ jaunt. Shameless: Cheryl Prudham, 33, who receives £39,000 in benefits, and her partner Robert are spending £10,000 on a lavish ceremony in Las Vegas to renew their wedding vows . Browsing: The couple, who hit headlines last year after demanding a bigger council house for their huge brood, visited her local Thomson travel agents in Kent to book the luxury family break . The pair, who have only just got back together after a short split because they want to have more children, were photographed this week visiting their local Thomson travel agent and taking away brochures for the American casino city. Mrs Prudham – who was also recently spotted flaunting an £895 Mulberry handbag as she strolled near their home in Gravesend, Kent – plans to wear a £1,000 designer gown for the ceremony. The couple will stay at the Circus Circus hotel and intend to renew their vows at the infamous Chapel of Love, before being whisked away in a chauffeur-driven limousine. They have also booked to see some shows and go on a helicopter tour across Nevada, a Sunday newspaper reported. It is not their first taxpayer-funded jaunt. Last year they took a £7,000 trip to Menorca, Spain. Mrs Prudham told Closer magazine at the time: ‘I don’t feel bad about using taxpayers’ money. We’re entitled to a holiday.’ The Prudhams claim £39,192 in benefits a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – bringing their total annual income up to almost £60,000. Planning: The duo are planning to fly to the U.S. in March for the two-week 'no-expense spared' break . Lavish: Last month, Mr and Mrs Prudham and some of their children were spotted leaving a designer shop in London . They managed to avoid the Government’s £26,000-a-year cap on state handouts because Mr Prudham works enough hours to claim working tax credit. The pair separated for a short time after Mr Prudham, who is the father of Mrs Prudham’s five youngest children, struck up a relationship with another woman online. But Mrs Prudham took him back in February because she wanted to have more children with him. She said: ‘We’re good at making babies ... and I get more in benefits with every child I have, so I can afford a big family.’ Her 12th child is due in July and the family, who live in a five-bedroom council house, are waiting to be upgraded to a seven-bedroom home because their current one is ‘too cramped’. Last month, the family attracted attention over their lifestyle when they were photographed leaving a Mulberry store at Westfield shopping centre in Stratford, East London. The brand’s handbags are seen as the height of luxury thanks to the fine leather used and the eye-watering prices to match. Mrs Prudham left the store with a shopping bag – thought to contain the much-coveted £895 Bayswater handbag she was recently spotted with. Happy families: The couple have been together six years, and Mr Prudham is the father of his wife’s five youngest children . Huge brood: The family get £39,192 in handouts a year on top of Mr Prudham’s monthly salary of £1,600 as a delivery driver – taking their annual income to nearly £60,000 .","Cheryl Prudham, 33, from Kent, planning to renew vows with husband Rob .

5013,28bc2f9dc0ce698b34ed7b27d0a88239a3b934e1,"Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is convinced there is more to come from striker Harry Kane after seeing him plunder his 30th goal of the season. Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker to reach the 30-mark with a late strike in his side's 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Newcastle on Sunday. However, Pochettino is convinced the 21-year-old England hitman can improve further as he continues to make his way in the game. Harry Kane calmly slots Tottenham's third goal in time added on after coming one-on-one with Krul . Kane celebrates putting the result beyond doubt as Spurs claim a 3-1 win over Newcastle . He said: 'He has big potential. He is young and this is his first full season in the first team. We need to push him to try to improve his level because he has the potential to improve. 'It's a fantastic achievement and I congratulate him. He deserves this moment because he has worked a lot. It's an historic thing. 'He's happy in the changing room and all his team-mates are happy, and I think all our supporters and the club are happy at his achievement.' If it was Kane who put the icing on the cake at St James' Park, it was Nacer Chadli and Christian Eriksen who paved the way for his late contribution as the visitors condemned Newcastle to a sixth successive league defeat. Chadli fired them in front on the half-hour and after Jack Colback had levelled 20 seconds after the restart, Eriksen scored with a free-kick which evaded all the yellow shirts in the middle and defeated keeper Tim Krul. Kane killed off any hopes of a second fightback when he rounded off a 91st-minute break to leave Pochettino delighted. Tottenham striker Kane at full stretch as he is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . Kane celebrates his goal against Newcastle as opposition goalkeeper Tim Krul looks on in despair . He said: 'We fully deserved the victory and the three points. I think our performance was better than Newcastle's and I am very pleased for our players. 'I am happy to recover this feeling after the last two games - that wasn't good and it's important to feel victory again.' It proved a difficult day for opposite number John Carver, whose side had to contend not only with Tottenham, but a boycott by some of their own fans. Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Vernon Anita . Carver insisted that had little impact - the official attendance at the 52,000-capacity stadium was 47,427 - but admitted the Magpies, who are currently seven points clear of the drop zone, are engaged in a survival fight. He said: 'Absolutely, we're in amongst it, there's no danger of that, because you have got sides - and I'll use Leicester as an example - who are winning games. We aren't. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise . Newcastle players join Colback as the hard-working midfielder pounces on a loose ball in the area . 'But we have got to find a way of trying to find some points and put some points on the board. We have to come up with a solution, I have to come up with a solution. 'I have to find a method of trying to play now that might not be pretty on the eye, but I need to find a way of getting some results, getting some points. People might not like what they see, but I'm going to have to do it.' Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at home . Fans applaud Newcastle's goals while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, Not Ashley' sign during the game . Geordie Carver was installed as Alan Pardew's replacement until the end of the season in January, and has found himself in the firing line virtually ever since, although he is refusing to throw in the towel. He said: 'It's probably the most difficult situation I have ever been in. But I'm a fighter and I'm not going to shirk anything. I'll take the stick and I'll take the responsibility because that's the type of person I am. 'But I'm not going to give up on it. Yes, I'm angry and I'm annoyed, and I've got my own thoughts in my head that will stay private. But I have just got to get on with it because nobody else is going to do it.'

3519,2beb3c90dd9c2fe8288f352b6b973b5a0b5dd0dc,"(CNN)ESPN's Britt McHenry this week found herself in the news, rather than reporting on it, after a video surfaced showing her berating and belittling an employee of a tow company in Arlington, Virginia. Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: ""I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey,"" and ""I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here."" And, finally, ""Lose some weight, baby girl."" It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and ""ugly on the inside"" to a ""sad, self-hating coward."" ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded . These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online . Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the ""power of the press"" without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and ""the return of class"" -- who express views like, ""Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies. At least Britt McHenry owns up to it.","Video shows ESPN reporter Britt McHenry berating and belittling a tow company worker .

The snapshot, which shows the man giving the peace sign as he flaunts his controversial shirt  at the festival held in Indio, California, sparked outrage after it was shared on Twitter on Sunday by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor of Vice's music and culture channel Thump. 'This guy wins the award for worst fashion/lifestyle choices @coachella. I'm not easy to offend, but this is sh**** [sic],' he tweeted along with the picture. Tasteless choice: An unidentified concert goer has come under fire for wearing a T-shirt featuring the words 'Eat Sleep Rape Repeat' (pictured) to Coachella on Sunday . First person account: The offensive photograph was shared by Jemayel Khawaja, the managing editor for Vice's music and culture channel Thump . The distasteful choice of words on the concert goer's shirt are thought to be a play on the Fatboy Slim song Eat Sleep Rave Repeat, which was released in 2013. '@JemayelK I thought at first this said ""eat sleep rave repeat"" until I read it carefully. Wtf [sic],' one critic commented on Jemayel's post. Another added: '@JemayelK @hannahgais @coachella can't even understand why someone would think that's funny... Or wearable in public [sic].' There were some who were willing to give the unidentified man the benefit of the doubt however, suggesting that the image may have been edited in order to make the garment appear more offensive than it actually was. Shameful shirt: Many commenters on Twitter wrote that they were shocked that someone would wear such an offensive top in public . Misspelling: Sam Houston questioned whether the shirt was real or not, hoping that the unidentified male's shirt was meant to say 'Rage' instead of 'Rape' Shout out: Meanwhile, Ben Gomori chose to insult the wearer of the shirt, calling him a 'F****** p****' '@JemayelK @coachella Is that real? I imagine it was meant to say “RAGE”? [sic],' one critic asked, while someone else added: '@JemayelK please say that's photoshopped?? [sic]' But Jemayel confirmed that he had taken the snapshot and seen the shirt with his own two eyes after one Twitter user asked: 'Before I jump on the appropriate rage wagon, did you take this picture yourself?' 'Yeah I did. Rage away,' he replied. The shirt, which doesn’t appear to be sold online, may have been custom-made for the event. Meanwhile, someone else confirmed that another Coachella reveler had taken to Twitter on Sunday to share their disgust after running into the man in the controversial T-shirt. Fashion faux pas: Another Twitter user revealed that she also saw the man wearing the controversial T-shirt . Shake it off: But not everyone was upset by the shirt. This person criticized Jemayel and told him to focus on 'real issues' 'The most inappropriate shirt at #Coachella goes to the guy wearing one that says ""Eat Sleep Rape Repeat"" - what the actual f***? [sic]' she wrote. Although not everyone agreed with a majority of the public's outrage. One Twitter commented on Jemayel's photo, writing: 'If this offends you, you're a p****. Grow a sack and focus on real issues, not feminist honeypot garbage.' Amid the debate over the questionable T-shirt, the first weekend of Coachella came to a close last night after Madonna planted a kiss on Drake, who looked horrified after the impromptu make-out session. The music festival will start again on Friday with performances from ACDC, Azealia Banks, Alabama Shakes and more.

The video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since being uploaded to YouTube, prompting all manner of bizarre explanations for the phenomenon - with many seemingly convinced it is definitive proof of extra-terrestrial life. Spine-chilling: The creepy footage shows a mysterious 100 metre-wide black ring of smoke floating over clear skies in Kazakhstan - convincing locals it was caused by a UFO . Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared. Once the cloud had rapidly dispersed, no trace of it was left in the sky. Speaking to local news website Today.kz, villager Oleg Menshikov said: 'It was like a black cloud. We saw it at around 4 pm on April 3. It dissipated like smoke, but it was completely odourless.' Within minutes of the video being shared online, YouTube users began to question whether the thick black hoop was an alien spacecraft, while others suggested it might just be cigarette smoke immediately in front of the camera but giving the perception it is in the sky. Others thought the cloud was likely to be a naturally occurring weather event known as a thermal microburst, which is caused by a falling mass of warm air.

Dispersing rapidly: Confused locals watched the mysterious cloud hover ominously over Shortandy for a quarter of an hour on Saturday morning before it vanished as quickly as it appeared . Experts believe the cloud was roughly 100 metres in diameter and floated close to a mile in the air. Speaking to Russia Today, Andrey Solodovnik - associate physics professor at the Northern Kazakhstan State University - dismissed suggestions the cloud was caused by aliens. He said that based on similar clouds seen in the skies in recent years, the giant black hoop was likely to have been little more than a smoke ring generated by combustion at nearby factories. Plenty of industrial machinery is known to create ring-shaped clouds of smoke, though these are usually lighter-coloured, considerably less dense and vanish in just one or two minutes. In the latest instance it is likely the cloud was far more visible and hung around in the sky for much longer than usual for the simple reason it was cloudless day with little to no wind.","Clip shows mysterious black cloud hanging over the village of Shortandy .

It may be time to consider a short, sharp trip to the suburbs of Beijing. Here, in a collection of drab, concrete buildings surrounding a large courtyard is a military-style bootcamp designed with one thing in mind: to treat victims of a very modern disease — a compulsive addiction to electronic gadgets. Formed in 2006, the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre (IATC) has so far welcomed 6,000 mostly young, mostly male patients — and claims to have ‘cured’ 75 per cent of them. Scroll down for video . Hooked up: With wires hanging from his head, a young boy undergoes electroencephalogram scans to measure brain activity.

Smart salute: At the Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre, it’s time to put down that mouse, pull on a camouflage T-shirt and learn to click heels, not screen icons . The man behind the facility is Tao Ran, a doctor and colonel in the People’s Liberation Army, regarded as China’s leading expert in wangyin, or internet addiction, which is said by the country’s government to affect 24 million of its 632 million internet users. He describes wangyin as a form of mental illness, saying that 90 per cent of his patients are clinically depressed from a lack of normal social interaction. Many have back and eyesight problems due to spending up to 14 hours a day staring at screens, and a third suffer from eating disorders. ‘Internet addiction leads to problems in the brain similar to those derived from heroin consumption but, generally, it’s even more damaging,’ Mr Ran said recently. ‘It destroys relationships and deteriorates the body without the person knowing.’ To break it, Mr Ran confiscates all electronic devices from patients and forces them to follow a super-strict, military-style fitness regime, starting with parade drills at 6.30 each morning. They must also endure occasional spells in solitary confinement and take regular medication. Progress is monitored by psychiatric assessments and regular brain scans. Mr Ran only considers someone cured if, six months after their release, they use the internet for fewer than six hours per day. Some critics have called the techniques brutal. But they also yield results and there is high demand for places: the IATC, which charges £1,000 per month (more than twice the average Chinese urban worker’s wage) recently expanded, so it can treat 130 patients at any one time. Work that body: Military-style drills, exercises and weekly tai chi sessions help the young addicts to shed their indoor pallor . Open wide: A nurse checks that 14-year-old Yin Yu Tao has taken his medication — all part of the £1,000-a-month bootcamp . It isn’t alone: there are around 300 such clinics in China, due largely to an explosion in the popularity of online games such as World Of Warcraft. Many internet cafes have beds, so customers can sleep at their keyboards, and Shanghai recently passed a law forcing parents to stop minors ‘being overindulgent with online and electronic games’. Meanwhile in Japan, where Facebook and Twitter are national obsessions, there are dozens of so-called internet ‘fasting camps’. Taiwan is also facing up to internet addiction — in January, its government voted to fine parents who allow children to spend ‘excessive time using electronic products’.

Former Destrehan High School teacher Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September after the teen in question started bragging to friends at the St Charles Parish, Louisiana school that he had slept with two teachers. An investigation later revealed that the unidentified teen had sex with both his current English teacher at the time, Dufresne, and his English teacher from the prior year, 24-year-old Rachel Respess - including an alleged a threesome with both at Respess's house.

Double the trouble: Dufresne (right) and fellow teacher Rachel Respess, 24 (left), were arrested in September when a student at Destrehan High School started bragging that he was sleeping with both of them . How they met: The unidentified 16-year-old victim was a student in Dufresne's English class last year. Respess taught the same student English the year prior . Though she originally pleaded not guilty in November, married mother-of-three Dufresne changed course and confessed to the sordid act at a status conference in court on Thursday. In exchange for pleading guilty to a count of obscenity, the original charge of carnal knowledge of a juvenile will be held for the three years Dufresne is under probation for obscenity. Comfortable: As part of her plea deal, Dufresne will not have to serve any jail time. Instead she will undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment program, surrender her teacher's license and stay away from the victim and his family . Dufresne must also undergo a 90-day inpatient mental health treatment, surrender her teacher's license, and stay away from the now 17-year-old victim and his family. If she complies with all of those terms, the carnal knowledge charge will be dropped after three years and she will not have to register as a sex offender. The carnal knowledge charge carries a maximum of ten years in prison and a fine for $5,000. Judge Anne Simon signed off on the plea deal, after three other judges - including Dufresne's father Judge Emile St Pierre - removed themselves from the case. District Attorney Joel Chaisson II heralded the deal as a success. 'I want to thank my special prosecutor, Julie Cullen, for her efforts to reach a fair resolution of the case and to secure a felony guilty plea, thereby sparing the juvenile victim in this matter from having to testify at a public trial,' the DA said in a statement. The parents of the victim were in court on Thursday, and according to media who attended the meeting, they were not happy with the settlement. However, Dufresne's legal battle is likely not over yet. When her relationship with the teen was exposed last fall, it was revealed that she had sex with the teen at a residence in Montz (Dufresne and her family live in Montz) and one in Kenner between August 22 and September 27. Dufresne still faces the possibility of jail time for allegedly having a threesome with the same student and Respess at Respess' residence in another Louisiana parish (pictured above). Neither woman has been formally arraigned on those charges yet . Above, Dufresne's home in Montz, Louisiana.

It was at Respess' home in Kenner that the teachers allegedly had a three-way with the student after a high school football game in September, and that is the incident they await arraignment on. Since her arrest on September 30, Dufresne has remained free on bond. While she has been under house arrest during this time, the rules of the sequester have been loosened so that she can attend therapy sessions, Jazzercize classes and help drive her 3, 5, and 7-year-old children to school and extracurricular activities. However, she had to spend 8pm to 7am inside her home during the weekdays. Both Dufresne and Respess were suspended from their jobs without pay following their arrests last fall.","Shelley Dufresne was arrested in September when a student at the high school she taught at started bragging about sleeping with two teachers .

Professor John Warren discovered avocado trees switch from male to female in a matter of hours . The flowers close for the night and then the next morning they reopen - but now they use their 'male anthers' to spread their pollen.

8722,513c24f2caf618ee196d03170ea8c77a7913171d,"For Inverness the latest chapter in their remarkable story featured not one, but two, plot-changing twists. One featured penalty Celtic didn't get for 2-0 in which Josh Meekings handball should have also led to a sending off. The other the spot kick they did, followed by a red card for Craig Gordon. 'I've not seen it yet, but going by the reaction of the Celtic players we got away with a penalty and a sending off and that was probably the turning point in the game,' acknowledged Caley manager John Hughes after. Inverness's Josh Meekings appears to get away with a handball on the line in their win over Celtic . Caley boss John Hughes says the break, which could have meant a penalty and red card, was a turning point . 'I've not spoken to Josh. I haven't seen it - but going by the media it was definitely a hand ball. We look at the referee behind the line and all that and I know Ronny will feel aggrieved - because I certainly would. 'But it's part and parcel of football and you need a wee bit of luck to beat Celtic. 'This was their biggest game of the season because they will go on and win the league and if they had beaten us today there was a good chance they would have gone on and won the Scottish Cup. 'But when Marley Watkins was clipped by Craig Gordon and they were down to 10 men that was advantage Inverness. 'We weren't going to give Celtic the ball back, they had to come and get it and we had to be patient. 'When big Edward put us into the lead we thought it was going to be our day on the back of things that had happened. 'Celtic equalised with another free kick but it's typical of Inverness that we don't do anything easy. 'We do it the hard way and we came up with the winner through David Raven.' Hughes hauled Raven, his Scouse defender, from his backside as extra-time beckoned. Offended by the sight of one of his players resting he had a message to impart. Caley players celebrate after upsetting Celtic in a Scottish Cup semi-final 3-2 thriller . Celtic, depleted by games and absentees, were virtually on their knees after a relentless programme of midweek games. In last season's League Cup Final Inverness had been passive and unambitious prior to losing on penalties. This was no time to repeat the mistake. 'I tried to emphasise to the players they would never have a better time to go on and beat Celtic, down to 10 men in the semi final of a cup. We needed to go for it,' Hughes said. 'Before Raven scored at the back post I was looking to change it. I was going to bring on another winger, Aaron Doran, and put him in the full-back position over on the right, but more advanced so he could take their left back on. Thankfully I didn't do that and David Raven came up with the goal. Virgil Van Dijk (centre) fired Celtic into an early lead with a superb free-kick in the 18th minute . 'I didn't realise this is the first time the club have been in the final of the Scottish Cup and that's a remarkable achievement given it was only formed 20 years ago. 'It is a great story isn't it? It's an absolutely fantastic story. It is 20 odd years since the amalgamation. We are a small provincial club up there in the Highlands. 'We have lost a real inspirational skipper in Richie Foran right from the start of the season. He has never played. We have had to adjust to that. 'We had to sell Billy McKay, our top goalscorer, at Christmas. We have had to go again and adjust. I am a very humble guy and I am grateful and thankful that injuries have never caught up with us.' There is remarkable irony in the fact Falkirk will be the opponents for the final. A former Bairns captain, he was manager of the club in 2009 when they lost to Rangers at Hampden. Former Falkirk captain and manager John Hughes will take on his former club in the final . 'I had a lot of great times at Falkirk. So much so that it is possibly my favourite time in my playing career. I am still friendly with an awful lot of the characters who were in that dressing room. Neil Oliver is a good friend of mine from my Falkirk days. He comes along and sits on the bench and gives me a wee hand out. 'That is the spirit that we had at that club. I have met some great guys. Brian Rice, my ex-coach, Davie Weir, Ian McCall, the list is endless. I was just talking the other day about that day at Falkirk. There are times even now when I see. 'I have a real special, special feel for the place. I am not kidded Falkirk is a right good side, trust me on that. No side goes to Tynecastle and beats Hearts without being a good side. No side beats Hibs the way they were playing without being a good side. You might say we are favourites I say it is even stevens and I am just looking forward to when the days comes.' David Raven (second right) celebrates with his Inverness team-mates following his extra-time winner . An Inverness and Falkirk final would not have been the choice of sponsors William Hill, you suspect. Vast swathes of Hampden's west stand were empty, a 12.15 kick-off for the benefit of broadcasters proving unhelpful . There will be no ticket rows this time. Not over a final unlikely to raise a crowd much higher than 35,000 in a stadium of 52,000. The contract with Hampden plc is signed, with no question of moving it. If the bitter amalgamation of 21 years ago produced a fine football club it also disenfranchised many of those who followed the old ones. 'I hope this encourages the next generation to follow Inverness,' added Hughes. 'In the peer groups it is still Celtic and Rangers they follow but I hope the next ones will want to support their local club. 'If we can add another few hundred or thousand to the support then we are playing our part.'","Josh Meekings handball should have been a penalty and a red card .

3790,b3b892e834f738e5de92d46fa267cc27837262f6,"As manager of Rangers, Stuart McCall has learned to tolerate supporters booing their own players. Growing up watching Leeds United, he was less forgiving. 'I remember Terry Yorath and Ray Hankin coming in for stick,' he recalled. 'As a teenager I used to get into fights because of it. 'I remember standing at the back of Leeds kop, maybe I was 15 or 16 year old and Yorath and Hankin were getting booed. Terry Yorath had just taken over from Billy Bremner and it was boooooo… . Rangers manager Stuart McCall has had to get used to his players being booed by supporters . Lee McCulloch, the Rangers captain, was booed for an error that led to a goal against Raith Rovers . McCall hopes that for the time that he is manager of Rangers, McCulloch will be the last player to get booed . 'They had a song for Ray Hankin and it went: 'Ray Hankin, Ray Hankin' and half of them would then shout: 'S**t' and this is while he was warming up for the game. 'That's when I got into fights, with the people shouting s**t. 'Tell me, how's that going to help any individual when that's the reaction to their name just being read out?' Those sour memories returned last weekend when Rangers skipper Lee McCulloch was the object of frustration from the Ibrox stands. Culpable for a Raith Rovers goal, the veteran defender suffered the embarrassment of being booed by his own supporters. He was hardly the first to suffer that fate. So long as McCall remains manager of Rangers – an unknown currently – he hopes McCulloch will be the last. 'I've no problem with a team being booed off at half time or full time, that's fine. People pay their money. 'But I think the individual thing is not on. It was sad to hear last week. 'The good thing was that within minutes of it happening most of the supporters actually turned it round and he was getting backing again. 'We were losing 2-0 and I think people thought: 'You know what, we need to help the team.' It spun itself round and then the majority of the supporters were clapping. 'If it hadn't turned itself round, I don't think we would've got back in the game.' In the west of Scotland, grown men rarely express their feelings. To sympathise would only have drawn attention to the captain's predicament. McCulloch has made no reference to the incident to McCall and vice versa. 'He just wants to get on with it,' added the manager. 'There's not a lot you can say anyway. 'I remember a situation with Michael Higdon at Motherwell. I had to put out a message saying: 'Lay off.' He ended up with 27 goals and player of the year. 'It doesn't help anybody if a player is booed. Yes, we all understand and accept frustration in the stands. But booing one of your own players isn't going to help. 'I fully accept that when you boo your team at half time and full time that's everyone's prerogative. But it's certainly not going to help anyone by scapegoating an individual. 'Is it going to make him feel good and feel like he's going to flourish or is he going to go into himself? Surely that's common sense.' Should McCulloch play against Hearts at Tynecastle on Saturday– and the indications are he will – the defiant, thrawn streak in away supporters will no doubt prompt a different response. Such is the must-win nature of the game and the raucous Gorgie atmosphere that an exaggerated show of support is likely. McCall expects the 36-year-old - a strong, experienced footballer - to be fine. 'Lee has a leadership mentally and he has been about. It's good he's not one of the younger ones. 'He's had highs and lows and he's been there and seen it and represented Rangers terrifically well in his career. 'Hopefully that's it and, although it happened, the overriding feeling for me was that other supporters turned it on its head and that made it better.' The need for Rangers to find some unity at Tynecastle is obvious enough. They must beat champions Hearts and hope Hibs – yet to beat Falkirk this season – show the mental fragility many now regard as their trademark. If Rangers do attain second place, it means two less play-off games. Perhaps more importantly it also avoids another trip to the artificial pitch of Queen of the South where they have already lost 2-0 and 3-0 this season. 'Whoever gets Queen of the South will have a hard game,' said McCall. 'We lost down there twice, but we did beat them once at Ibrox and drew with them, too. 'If we have to go down there, we would be confident because we would have to play them at a full Ibrox as well, which would give everyone a huge lift. 'They have done really well and had two good results against us, but if we play Queen of the South and Hibs - or just Hibs - they will be tough games. 'We've obviously got to win to get second and that's what we'll try to do. Obviously, there is a slight advantage to finishing second with playing two less games. But when it comes down to it, you are just going to have win football games. McCulloch is in line to play for Rangers against league leaders Hearts at the weekend . McCall questioned whether fans booing their own players has any positive impact upon the team . 'If we manage to win at Hearts and Hibs don't win, there will be no great celebrations from our point of view because we won't have achieved anything. 'We've got into the play-offs but, either way, all the hard work is in front of us. 'We're aiming to win on Saturday, we think we can win, but I just really want a good, strong performance to go into the play-offs.'","Captain Lee McCulloch was booed by Rangers supporters last weekend .

9136,ac6ff1d71829303c5a7c8a2239e477c6c1f9a433,"(CNN)Indonesia has a tough stance on drug smugglers, and since assuming office in October, President Joko Widodo has made it clear he intends to show no mercy toward those found guilty of such crimes. That tough stance casts a further pall on two Australian drug smugglers, part of the so-called ""Bali Nine."" They are waiting to learn whether they will be put to death by firing squad after an Indonesian court rejected a last ditch effort to gain clemency from Widodo on Monday. April marks a decade on death row for Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for their part in a failed heroin smuggling plot. The 31-year-old Chan has been called the ringleader and 33-year-old Sukumaran has been described as his collaborator.  The seven others who took part in the operation are serving lengthy prison sentences for trafficking the drugs. The members of the Bali Nine were arrested after Indonesian police received a tip from Australian Federal Police. Four members of the group were caught at Denpasar International Airport with more than 8 kilograms of heroin strapped to their bodies.  Four others, including Sukumaran, were arrested at a hotel in the village of Kuta.  Although he wasn't carrying any drugs, Chan was detained after boarding a plane to Sydney.  He was named by others as the mastermind of the smuggling plot. While the purported ringleaders have received media attention for years, the other seven members of the Bali Nine have rarely been in the spotlight. Here's a quick look at the other members of the group: . Scott Rush . Indonesian prosecutors asked for and received a sentence of life in prison for several of the Bali Nine, who were identified as drug couriers in the operation. That includes Scott Rush of Brisbane, Australia. Rush was 19 when he was captured in Indonesia. He was arrested at Denpasar Airport with more than 1 kilogram of heroin strapped to his body. Michael Czugaj . Life in prison was the original sentence for 29-year-old Michael Czugaj, also of Brisbane. Nineteen at the time of his arrest, Czugaj is one of five of the Bali Nine whose sentence was reduced to 20 years in prison, then reinstated at life again.  During his trial, Czugaj testified he was lured into the drug scheme with the promise of a free holiday to Bali. He was quoted in news reports as saying his life was threatened, as well as his family's, if he refused to cooperate with the heroin smuggling operation. Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen . Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen from Brisbane, who is now 31, was one of four drug couriers in the case. He was found in a hotel room on Bali's Kuta Beach with a small amount of heroin and drug paraphernalia. Si Yi Chen and Matthew Norman . The others are Si Yi Chen, 30 and Matthew Norman, 28, both from Sydney.  Foreignprisoners.com quotes Chen as saying he deeply regrets his actions and did not mean to hurt others, especially his family.   Norman is quoted on the same website expressing remorse for his actions and hopes that people back home, ""don't judge me too harshly.""  He says he has two sisters including a twin. Foreignprisoners.com is run by Foreign Prisoner Support Service, a nonprofit organization based in South Africa. Martin Stephen and Rena Lawrence . The same website details information about Martin Stephens, now 39, and the only woman in the Bali Nine, 37-year-old Renae Lawrence. Stephens was a former bartender from Towradgi, a suburb of Wollongong in New South Wales. He claims he was forced to travel to Bali and take part in the drug smuggling operation after death threats against his family. Lawrence, from Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, was arrested with heroin strapped to her body.  She claims Chan threatened her life if she did not take part in the scheme.  During her court appeal, Lawrence apologized to Indonesia for her actions.  Her original life sentence was also reduced to 20 years. During a court appearance in 2006, Chan denied threatening anyone.  He told the Denpasar District Court before his sentencing in February of that year:  ""A lot of lies have been said against me, but the true reality is I'm not what people put me out to be. I've never threatened anybody in my life."" The Denpasar District Court also dismissed claims that Chan made threats against Lawrence and Rush when the two were sentenced in 2006. Australia has repeatedly called for clemency for Chan and Sukumaran. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Monday, ""The Government is disappointed at today's decision by the State Administrative Court of Jakarta to reject the appeals of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. We understand that the legal team for Mr. Chan and Mr. Sukumaran is considering other legal options."" In a news release posted to the Australian government's website, Bishop cited the ""extensive rehabilitation"" both men have undergone and said she will continue to appeal to her counterpart while Australia continues to ""use all diplomatic options to seek a stay of execution.""","Two Australian drug smugglers, part of the Bali Nine, await word whether they'll face a firing squad .

The findings come after the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said he was dubious about using technology as a teaching aid in non-IT classes. However, research into the effects of the devices on literacy levels suggests the best outcome comes from youngsters sharing devices. Children who share iPads in class do much better in early literacy tests than those who don’t, researchers claim (stock image above) Courtney Blackwell, at Northwestern University in the US, found that, in tests, kindergarten children who shared iPads in classes over an academic year significantly outscored their peers who were in classes that had no iPads or in which each student had their own device. Shared iPad students scored around 30 points higher than students who used the device on their own and non-iPad users. She worked with 352 students at a Midwestern suburban school district during the research. Miss Blackwell said the findings suggest it’s the ‘collaborative learning around the technology that made the difference, not just the collaboration in and of itself’.

7876,b8803c87ad83ffc194b4161bfcdd6e9584e7d653,"(CNN)Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women's groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for ""lost"" wages as a result of the so-called wage gap. In the wake of Hillary Clinton's presidential announcement, the ""holiday"" has special meaning. Clinton's election will no doubt center on women voters, and the Democratic women's agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace. Here's the thing: That 77-cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated. It's a comparison of averages -- comparing full-time working women with full-time working men -- that doesn't control for any of the important factors that go into determining one's salary such as education, profession, title, time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day, to name a few. When we do control for these variables, a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4-6 cents, some of which may be the result of gender discrimination, but also is likely a function of women's choices and different behavior, such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply can't control. The new women warriors: Reviving the fight for equal rights . I frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the ""mistake"" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal. Add to this the fact that I took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family, and my earning potential simply isn't as high as some of my male counterparts. Opinion: Why Hillary Clinton should take a pay cut . Still, conservatives -- and by extension Republicans -- ought to be paying attention to Equal Pay Day. Because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the ""war on women"" narrative was over. That Democrats had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as Colorado's Mark Udall simply couldn't succeed. In some respects, Republicans are right. Voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric, and in many ways they rejected the insidious ""war on women"" narrative. The facts about the gender wage gap . But women voters are valuable, and Equal Pay Day ought to be a reminder that Democrats aren't ready to surrender. Let's remember a 5-point national gender gap still remains in the Democrats' favor. Bottom line: The ""war on women"" narrative hasn't been turned off -- it's simply shifted gears. And with the presidential election season just revving up, we can expect to see the ""war on women"" focus turn to the workplace, where Democrats will claim women are paid unfairly, not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand. Many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls. But nothing could be further from the truth. Map: Where the gender pay gap is the widest . The Independent Women's Forum conducted a randomized, controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap, and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the Paycheck Fairness Act -- a legislative ""solution"" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for Democrats. In short, if the right is silent on the issue, the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war. It's tempting on days such as Equal Pay Day for Republicans to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by Wednesday. But the reality is that's the worst thing conservatives can do. The public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity, and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond.","Sabrina Schaeffer: Tuesday is Equal Pay Day, a fictitious holiday marked by progressive women .

A conman has been jailed for stealing a pensioner's entire £401,000 life savings and using it to finance his dream wedding and honeymoon. Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the £400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard. Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there. He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited £500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier. Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money. The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend £15,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milk . From there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans. But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon. Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear. In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life. 'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.' Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him. 'The thought of the inevitable custodial sentence has been utterly terrifying,' he said. 'Since his arrest it has been a palpable fear which has affected the quality of his life.' But the judge ignored his plea and jailed him.","Kevin Franklin left his 80-year-old victim without any money to buy milk .

1078,061ea0d20afc4fbab2bac7117e001eef3ecf4a5c,"Audi has created a so-called 'green' diesel fuel made using a combination of water and carbon dioxide. The car manufacturer described its breakthrough as the 'fuel of the future' and claims it could provide a carbon neutral way of powering vehicles. Experts used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel. Scroll down for video . Audi claims to have created the fuel of the future - diesel (shown above) made from water and carbon dioxide. Experts used renewable energy to convert the carbon dioxide and water into a form of crude oil known as 'blue crude', which was then refined into diesel . Tests have shown it can be mixed with diesel from fossil fuels, or used as a fuel in its own right. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. Reiner Mangold, head of sustainable product development at Audi, said: 'In developing Audi e-diesel we are promoting another fuel based on carbon dioxide that will allow long‑distance mobility with virtually no impact on the climate. Audi's fuel was developed with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature. The hydrogen is then pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures. This causes them to react to produce long-chained liquid hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are the basic building block of all fossil fuels, but the compounds produced in the reactor are known as 'blue crude'. Audi claims the whole process can be powered using renewable energy and can be achieved with an efficiency of around 70%. The blue crude can then be refined in a similar way to standard crude oil to produce e-diesel. 'Using carbon dioxide as a raw material represents an opportunity not just for the automotive industry in Germany, but also to transfer the principle to other sectors and countries.' The new fuel was developed by Audi along with Sunfire, a Dresden-based energy technology company. To make the fuel, water is first heated to form steam, which is then broken down into its constituent hydrogen and oxygen using high-temperature electrolysis. By performing this process at temperatures above 800°C (1,472°F), the water breaks down with greater efficiency than at room temperature.

Hydrogen is  pumped into a reactor with carbon dioxide at high pressure and high temperatures and causes them to react to produce liquid hydrocarbons, known as 'blue crude'. Hydrocarbons form the base of fossil fuels . Audi added that the synthetic fuel does not contain sulphur or hydrocarbon rings – known as aromatic hydrocarbons – which are found in crude oil and can create additional pollution. A breakthrough was recently made in the development of clean hydrogen power. Currently, while hydrogen fuel is appealing, the production of hydrogen is incredible difficult - requiring huge amounts of energy. But the researchers say they have made a new material that can generate hydrogen from water, meaning it is less reliant on fossil fuels. Researchers at the University of Bath and Yale University have designed a molecular catalyst to split water in an electrolyser and create clean and storable hydrogen fuel. The approach increases the efficiency of electrolysis of water into its constituent parts by reducing the amount of energy needed to perform the  oxidation half of the reaction. Christian von Olshausen, chief technology officer at Sunfire, said the fuel was highly combustible and produced less pollution than traditional diesel. He said: 'The engine runs quieter and fewer pollutants are being created.' A special processing plant has been built in Dresden Reick and is set to produce 3,000 litres of e-diesel in the coming months. The carbon dioxide is currently supplied by a biogas facility as a byproduct. Audi said it also extracts carbon dioxide from the ambient air using 'direct air capturing'. Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of carbon dioxide emissions by humans into the atmosphere and is driving global warming. By capturing emissions from power plants and removing it from the air, Audi says its new fuel can be used without adding to the burden of gas in the atmosphere. The project is the latest attempt by Audi to produce more environmentally friendly fuels for its vehicles. Audi has already begun using the new e-diesel to power the official car of German minister of education and research Dr Johanna Wanka. The minister is pictured testing the new fuel in her official car . In 2009 it announced a project to produce e-gas - a form of synthetic methane – for use in its g-tron gas powered vehicles. At the launch of the new e-diesel, Dr Wanka put five litres of the fuel into her official Audi A8. She said: 'This synthetic diesel, made using carbon dioxide, is a huge success for our sustainability research. 'If we can make widespread use of carbon dioxide as a raw material, we will make a crucial contribution to climate protection and the efficient use of resources, and put the fundamentals of the ""green economy"" in place.'","German car manufacturer used renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into 'blue crude' oil which was then refined into diesel .

The granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has admitted falsely claiming almost £18,000 in benefits. Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed housing benefit and council tax benefit even though she was living in a home owned by her mother and her partner, who was also working. Wilkinson, who was a British Airways cabin crew attendant, was ordered to pay back a total of £17,604 that she claimed over two years when she appeared at South and East Cheshire Magistrates Court last week. She admitted two charges of dishonestly making false representations in order to claim housing benefit, Council Tax benefit and income support. Magistrates sentenced her to 24 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 24 months and ordered her to pay costs of £675 and a victim surcharge of £50. Her grandfather, Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977. He was sacked over his affair with the wife of the team's physio in 1977. Steph Cordon, Cheshire East Council's head of communities, said: 'It is a big mistake for fraudsters to think they can get away with claiming benefits they are not entitled to. 'They risk ending up with a criminal conviction for a serious offence of dishonesty and being ordered to repay the money they have falsely claimed. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards benefit fraud because we are determined to ensure that the benefits system works for people who really need help.' Wilkinson of  Knutsford, applied for housing benefit and Council Tax benefit in April 2011, saying that she was on a low income, was living in a privately-rented property and needed assistance with her rent and council tax, a court heard, . Football star: Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977, pictured here after winning the FA Cup in his final year at the club . She also made a claim for income support to help her and her daughter as she had no other income. Fundraising: A pregnant Amy Wilkinson outside Downing Street in 2011 after she raised £10,000 for charity after the death of her son . However, investigators from Cheshire East Council's benefit fraud investigation team and the Department for Work and Pensions found she had failed to declare that her mother owned the property for which she was claiming housing benefit. They also discovered that Wilkinson's partner had joined her household in January 2012 and had been supporting her and the family financially. Over a two-year period, she received a total of £17,604 in state benefits that she was not entitled to. She will have to repay in full the benefits that she fraudulently obtained. In 2011 she raised more than £10,000 for baby charity Tommy's and was thanked by the Chancellor George Osborne, who is also her local MP. She spent 18 months fundraising after she went into labour at 29 weeks and lost her son, Billy John, who tragically only lived for three minutes. Describing why she raised the money she said at the time: 'I was 29 weeks pregnant when I went into labour but they don't know why, there's just no answer for it. I needed something to focus on. 'Tommy's has been fabulous with us and on their website, they have a forum where you can talk to other people about it.

Among them, strips of brightly-coloured running track, which have been installed in the airport's hallways. While of course passengers are entertained by the latest buzzworthy stunt, we have to wonder: were they really intended to encourage travellers to dash to their boarding gate? Tokyo's Narita Airport has installed running tracks in its new Terminal 3 in honour of the 2020 Olympics . Turns out that the cushioned tracks were actually designed to celebrate the 2020 Olympics, which will be held in Tokyo. But there's no denying that the footpaths are extremely useful regardless. The blue path leads passengers toward departures, while arrivals can be reached by following the red pathway. Further, in each lane there are a series of icons, which include information such as the distance to other terminals, directions to nearby restaurants and shops and where to find outside transport options. The recently-opened terminal will be primarily used for departures and arrivals of low-cost carriers . To save money, the airport installed these cushioned running tracks, which also include directional information . All of the blue lanes lead towards the departure area, while the red track leads travellers to arrivals . The new terminal, which will be used for many of the city's low-cost carrier departures, first opened on April 8 and according to the website, the aim of the innovative tracks was, in part, to save money. 'To cut costs, we opted not to install the typical moving walkways or illuminated signs,' the terminal's website reads. 'Instead, to offer an exciting walking experience that is easy on the feet, we implemented running tracks used for track and field, and added signage for user-friendly guidance.'","In Terminal 3, cushioned running paths direct passengers to their gates .

8814,412fbd69c571e33bc62697987a62f675cad09069,"Rangers boss Stuart McCall says he is already working on a dossier of signing targets for next season - even though he may not be around to parade them. The interim Ibrox manager still does not know if he will be in charge beyond the current campaign after being lured back to his old club to kick-start their faltering promotion bid. So far, everything is going to plan with Gers second in the Scottish Championship table and destined for a semi-final play-off slot. Stuart McCall says he is already looking at transfer targets for next season, though he may not be at Rangers . But with 12 players out of contract, McCall knows the Light Blues will need to strengthen if they have any chance of keeping pace with rivals Celtic next season - if they go up - and is already piecing together a wish list of potential new arrivals. He said: 'I've been speaking to a lot of agents and putting things in place for if and when... Even if I'm not here, if I'm getting players put to me who would like to come to Rangers regardless of the manager, then we build a little portfolio of positions that we will be needing next year. 'It's not a case of us standing still and then thinking come June 1, 'Oh we need to get into action'. 'No, there are a lot of agents who come to us and we build a little dossier of players that as a staff, we think will be good for next season, regardless of what league we are in. 'It would be slightly naive [if we were not doing that]. If I'm in charge or not, I still want the club to do well and I will put my view across to the board on who I think should be coming into the club and who should be here.' McCall is compiling a dossier on targets as he looks to put the club in the best possible position . Rangers have operated a haphazard transfer policy since re-emerging from the embers of liquidation. The club's team of scouts were jettisoned under the disastrous Craig Whyte regime and former boss Ally McCoist was largely forced to turn to a list of former Ibrox servants he had personal knowledge of when trying to bolster his squad. But McCall revealed the club's new board are now starting the process of re-establishing their spying network - albeit on a smaller level than before. 'I think there has been discussions behind the scenes with different people,' said the former Motherwell boss. 'I don't think we are at the stage where we were 10 or 15 years ago where we were aiming to get into the Champions League and bringing players in for three and four million yet. 'I don't think Rangers will be at the stage yet next year where we need international scouts everywhere. Rangers have expanded their scouting network after a haphazard system over the past few years . 'But certainly a scouting network needs to be put in place. 'Having said that, I spoke to Craig Levein at Hearts and they do a lot of their scouting with [online service] Wyscout. When I brought Henrik Ojamaa in at Motherwell, that was after I'd seen a clip of him on YouTube. I sold him for £350,000 after signing him for nothing. That was great. 'So you can still do your own background work. Personally I would always like to see the player myself. I've only ever signed one player without watching him first and slightly regretted it. 'So yeah we need a scouting network but at this moment where Rangers are, not to the extent where we have scouts all over Europe.' McCall admitted he still does not know if he will rejoin Gordon Strachan's Scotland staff for the June 13 Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland in Dublin. And he also confessed to uncertainties ahead of Saturday's match with Falkirk. McCall's side are still in line for promotion, sitting in the play-off positions in the Scottish Championship . Peter Houston's Bairns - five points behind fourth-placed Queen of the South with two games to play - need an unlikely series of results to make the play-offs but McCall says that raises more questions than answers. He said: 'Housty is a wily old fox who has done terrifically well in his career so I don't know what to expect. 'It will take a difficult set of results for them to get into the play-offs so I don't know if they will come here and think the pressure is off and play care free. 'They don't lose many goals so we may have to be patient through the 90 minutes. We have had a couple of decent results against them but they have capable players and we will need to be at our best.'","Rangers are currently second in the Scottish Championship .

Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine, while another had traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked, a newspaper investigation revealed. While the venues do let players as young as 18 in, the majority of attendees are elderly, and the discoveries mirror a spike in OAPs being treated for drug abuse. Out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country, seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets, while this one, in Hengrove Leisure Park, Bristol, was found to have traces of crack cocaine . Class A: While bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit, the majority of visitors are pensioners (pictured, Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol, where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets) Figures from Public Health England show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year, a rise of 20 per cent in a year, and double the rates seen in 2009. A probe by The Sun used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country. The news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly, with 634 treated for addiction last year (stock picture) Two Gala Bingo premises in Clydebank Retail Park and Hawthorne Quadrant, Glasgow, tested positive for the drug, while Mecca Bingo in Coral Island, Blackpool, also showed traces of cocaine. Gala Bingo in Basildon and Mecca Bingo in Romford, Essex, also had positive results, as did Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol. Another Bristol venue, Gala Bingo in Hengrove Leisure Park, tested positive for crack cocaine, which is highly addictive. Kate Lawrence, of drug charity Phoenix Futures, told the paper’s Grant Rollings that the findings were unsurprising, adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness, or to socialise. She said: 'We assume older people don't want to go out and socialise, but they do, particularly if they are lonely. Loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs. 'The older generation isn't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs. Representatives from both Mecca Bingo and Gala Bingo said that their companies took a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises. Figures released early last year showed that, as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems, thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit. Busted: Mecca Bingo Blackpool was among the eight premises where traces of Class A drugs were found . Zero tolerance: Both Gala Bingo and Mecca Bingo said drug taking was banned in both of their venues (pictured, Gala Bingo in Basildon, where cocaine traces were discovered) More than 2,000 people in their 60s, 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago. The dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s, and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades. The majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine, although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis, amphetamines and prescription medications.","Out of 17 bingo halls tested, seven revealed traces of cocaine in toilets .

The former premier made an unannounced visit to Ulaanbataar last month in his capacity as a consultant to the cash-strapped government, which is dogged by allegations of endemic corruption. He met new Mongolian prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg but the secrecy surrounding his trip stoked fears from ecologists and the opposition that he is being deployed to encourage Western investment to the country to massively increase gold, copper and coal mining, despite acute environmental worries. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair with a Mongolian dignitary on his recent visit. The former British premier has been dragged into a row over gold mining plans which could destroy the ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors . A silver plate from the Noyon Uul burials, where some of the ancestors of Attila the Hun (right) are buried . An excavation at Noyon Uul. Ecologists fear a mining boom in the region could destroy sacred treasures . Specifically, there is concern over plans for development of the sacred pine-covered Noyon Uul region around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar which has £1.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation, dating back to the first century BC. 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn, citing official sources. The news outlet - which claimed Blair had flown 'secretly' to Mongolia last week - also speculated he was advising on another controversial project, involving expansion of multinational Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert, and a possible bailout from the IMF. Atilla was a feared fifth century barbarian warrior who ruled the Hunnic Empire from the Urals to the Rhine. He was born in modern-day Hungary, but his fearsome forebears are seen as originating much further east, in Mongolia. Activists from ecological pressure groups including Save Noyon Uul have protested to the government that plans for a foreign mining company to exploit gold reserves 'will destroy the historical monuments of the Mongols and their ancestors. 'Driven to despair, they promised that if the Mongolian government allows mining in the sacred land of the Mongols, its defenders are ready to give their lives to save Noyon Uul', said one report last week. Mr Blair's visit to Ulaanbataar was not noted on his website. His office said he makes regular Mongolia trips . Noyon Uul is around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar and has £1.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation dating back to the first century BC . 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn . Silver decorations for a harness recovered from the burial site. It has up to 200 burial mounds . The Mongolian premier - who recruited Blair to Mongolia two years ago when he held the position of cabinet minister - is seen as the leading advocate of the plan to boost mining in several regions, including Noyon Uul, where Canadian company Centerra Gold may be given the go-ahead to exploit significant reserves. He lunched with the former Labour Party leader after he held a 'text message referendum', dismissed as a cheap gimmick by foes, aimed at garnering support for new mining to boost the flagging economy. The country's president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has 'a strong stance against mining of Noyen Uul and wants to leave the cultural heritage site intact', evidently contrary to the position of his prime minister, it was reported. There was no mention of the Mongolian trip on the official website of The Office of Tony Blair, nor any comment from the Ulaanbaatar government on whether his work includes advice on exploiting 50 tons of gold reserves. But Mongolia is under severe pressure to raise revenue from mining to head off an economic crisis after foreign investment slumped 74 per cent last year, with speculation also centering on Tavan Tolgoi, one of the world's largest untapped coal deposits in the South Gobi Desert. Tony Blair Associates one year ago hired Anand Pillai, formerly an adviser to Rio Tinto in Mongolia. Noted Russian scientist Natalia Polosmak - who has made sensational archeological discoveries at Noyon Uul - said: 'This was the burial ground of the Hun elite. Tony Blair takes part in discussions during his visit. He was recruited to work with Mongolia two years ago .

'The collection of fabrics that we found there is unique.' Among the precious finds were elaborate chariots buried with Hun warlords, unique fabrics, ancient jewellery, plaques decorated in silver and gold, and carvings of fantastical creatures. A spokesperson from Mr Blair's office said: 'Tony Blair regularly visits Mongolia as part of his project there - which is already in the public domain - and has a full time team working on helping the government with its reform programme. 'He has nothing whatever to do with any gold mining business or other mining there so we don't know what is being referred to.' A spokesman for Centerra Gold, referring to the company's Gatsuurt mine in the Noyon Uul region, said: 'Our Gatsuurt property has been designated as a deposit of strategic importance. 'We are continuing to work with the government to determine the level of Mongolian ownership in the project and before Gatsuurt can proceed. We need a deposit development agreement and the necessary permits, approvals and regulatory commissioning.

The Whole Damn Farm, which costs £13.50, is the creation of Sam Longhurst, head chef of Splendid Kitchen, Manchester. He devised the mega meal - which contains two beef patties and a whole fried chicken thigh - after he was challenged by diners to create a burger containing three kinds of meat. The Whole Damn Farm burger features two beef burgers, homemade bacon jam, ham chunks, a whole chicken thigh, barbequed pulled pork and bacon rashers . Ready, get set, go! Customer Angela Fox gets ready to take on the mighty meat challenge . The monstrous meat feast has two beef burgers weighing 220g, a layer of homemade bacon jam, 100g of ham chunks and a 150g whole battered and fried chicken thigh. Added to that is 80g of barbequed pulled pork and four rashers of bacon all sandwiched between two brioche buns. With a meat equivalent of six Big Macs the burger was created after a customer presented with the restaurant's 'Cow & Chicken' burger - a feast in its own right - remarked, 'It's almost the whole damn farm.' Mr Longhurst said: 'We are always up for a challenge and when a customer seemed disappointed by a burger that only contained beef and chicken, we knew we had to take it one step further. 'You could say we've taken it several steps further as there are six different forms of meat on there. I think it'll keep the punters satisfied.'

'He kept looking at me and there was nothing I could do.' Not a habit: Ms Hannant said it was the first time Cody had escaped from his field in six months of living there . Almost there: Cody was glad when he could finally touch down on dry land again. He was taken to his stables to see a vet who gave him painkillers, vitamin injections and a booster . Ms Hannant feared the firefighters would accidentally break Cody's leg or the 15-hand horse would panic and colic (stomach cramps), which is potentially fatal. The mum-of-three, who also has a baby grandchild, praised London Fire Brigade saying: 'They were all trying to keep him calm. 'They were talking about getting a crane at one point.' It took crews an hour-and-a-half to rescue Cody, who was lifted from the water by a device under his stomach. Ms Hannant said: 'No one could believe he was a white horse. 'When he got out he looked like Black Beauty.' It was the first time Cody escaped from his field in six months of living there. She thinks her water-loving horse broke out through a hole in the fence and jumped in for a swim, not realising he would get stuck. Horsing around: There was even talk of a crane having to be used at one point but rescuers eventually freed the Havana cob. His owner, Tracey Hannant, believed the horse had probably gone for a swim to cool off . Back at home: Cody's owner Tracey Hannant spoke of the moment he was rescued. She said: 'No one could believe he was a white horse. When he got out he looked like Black Beauty.' Her son Tyler, 13, with the horse . On dry land: Cody is enjoying being back home in his field with Tyler, who was out riding the horse again following the animal's rescue from a ditch in Anderson Way in Belvedere, south London on Friday last week . She spent all day Monday building a new electric fence to keep Cody and her other four horses safe. Ms Hannant added: 'Cody is not just a horse, I have brought him up since he was six-months-old. 'I felt so helpless. That was the worst pain I have ever known in my life.'

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices. Argentinian news website DiarioVeloz.com said Davila, who worked in PR for a bowling alley, told police she was forced to commit the crimes to pay off her debts to a drug dealer .","Sofia Davila, 21, nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook' over crimes .

10967,9d1d5e52f9f4e75519a8976066556563c7c74568,"A Chicago single mother has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement. Adriana Alvarez, 22, says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having worked for McDonald's for five years. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees of the fast food chain began to protest. Scroll down for video . Single mother Adriana Alvarez, 22, has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement in Chicago . Alvarez (pictured with her three-year-old son Manny) says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having word for McDonald's for five years . The mother revealed in a column for Refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a 'decent place to live' with good schools for her three-year-old son Manny. 'When it rains, water steeps into the apartment,' Alvarez writes of her basement home, the only place she said she can afford. 'This wetness brings mold, and I can't get rid of the smell. We can’t even leave anything on the floor... toys or anything else on the floor may get ruined when the water comes in.' Alvarez said that, after paying for 'child care, transportation to work, food, rent, and our other basic expenses,' she can never afford to give anything else to her son. 'Every time I think about taking Manny somewhere fun, like to a movie, I have to think about whether we can really afford the gas,' she writes. The mother said even providing the specific milk her son, who drinks 'a half-gallon every two days', requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle. Since it's a more expensive brand, it uses up most of the $80 Alvarez is allotted in food stamps, she told the New York Times. Alvarez said her situation is not unique. She said that most of her co-workers are 'in the same boat', forced to rely on government assistance 'no matter how long they've held their jobs'. According to one study cited in Business Insider, half of the nation's fast food workers require some kind of government assistance, costing taxpayers $7billion a year. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting . Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage . And $1.2billion of that public assistance goes to employees of McDonald's annually, reported a study released by the National Employment Law Project. Just weeks ago, McDonald's announced that it would be giving a $1 pay raise for about 90,000 employees, effectively making their wage $10 an hour. But the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation. Restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were ineligible for the wage bump, which Alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 McDonald's employees. And, even for those who do get an increased wage, Alvarez argues that the number would 'hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty'. And higher wages aren't all Alvarez and her co-workers are fighting for. She said Fight For $15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union 'without interference from management'. A group of protesters in New York stage a die-in as part of a day of rallies and protests by fast-food workers known as 'Fight for $15 on April 15' Fight For $15 (pictured protesting on Wednesday) started two years ago in New York, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving . Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. The movement staged rallies across the country yesterday in honor of 'Fight for $15 on April 15'. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand a wage raise. There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change. But Alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon. 'It doesn't seem right that people who work with children or who serve food aren't paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table,' she writes. 'We want our families to be able to look forward to a better future.' There has been some change.

8933,a67939e6939b1cb731d804068f39444289444433,"(CNN)Wednesday's game between the Baltimore Orioles and Chicago White Sox will be closed to the public, the Orioles announced Tuesday. The closed-door contest follows the postponements of Monday's and Tuesday's games against the White Sox until a doubleheader scheduled for May 28 following unrest in Baltimore. A source within Major League Baseball told CNN the league is not aware of any prior closed-door games in major league history. The game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards is scheduled to begin at 2:05 p.m. ET. The game will be televised on the MASN regional cable network. ""After conferring with local officials, it was determined that Wednesday afternoon's game should be played without fan admittance in order to minimize safety concerns,"" Major League Baseball said. The office of new Commissioner Rob Manfred said the league and Orioles will keep an eye on the situation in Baltimore. ""Our thoughts are with all those who have been affected by violence in Baltimore, and everyone in our game hopes for peace and the safety of a great American city,"" Manfred said. Hall of Famer Frank Thomas tweeted that the series should be moved to a later date. The former White Sox star said, ""Playing in front of a empty house makes no sense!!"" The game changes come as the situation in the city remains tense following Monday's riots, with more protests and arrests Tuesday. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said the closed game will mean ""another sad day in our city."" ""We're a sports town. We love our O's,"" Rawlings-Blake told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The Orioles said tickets from Monday's postponed game can be used for admittance on May 28. Fans with tickets for Tuesday's game must exchange them for tickets for any remaining home game, including May 28. The team also announced it would move three games (May 1-3) against the Tampa Bay Rays to Florida. The Orioles will still be the home team, the team said. Fans with tickets for those games and Wednesday's contest can swap their tickets for future games, based on the dollar amount of the ticket. Exchanges must be completed by June 30, the team said. The Orioles have averaged more than 33,000 fans in their first nine games at Camden Yards this season, about 73% of capacity. According to MLB.com, games have been postponed in the past because of security concerns. In 1992, four Los Angeles Dodgers games were pushed back because of riots after the acquittals of police officers in the Rodney King case. In 1967, riots in Detroit prompted baseball officials to move games between the Tigers and the Orioles to Baltimore. Opening Day of 1968 was postponed for two days after the killing of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, all professional baseball was called off for one week. ESPN anchor and baseball expert Keith Olbermann tweeted that a September 1882 game hosted by Worcester had six fans come, the lowest spectator turnout for a major league game.

101,4a9172eee3b65bbf2e3309b7b785d76fa6d8eb24,"Thousands of holidaymakers face up to three days of chaos and cancelled flights because of a strike by French air traffic controllers. EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers. 'Ryanair said all affected customers have been contacted by email and text message and advised of their options - full refund, free transfer onto next available flight or free transfer onto an alternative flight routing.'","Strike is set to begin at 5am tomorrow and continue for two days .

We get on better with each other over a meal, according to researchers who said it makes everyone from work colleagues to children seem more pleasant. Dutch and Canadian scientists asked nearly 100 men and women to fill in a questionnaire every time they spent at least five minutes talking to someone else. Well digested: Scientists have found people felt happier and more relaxed while eating at home or at work . About a fifth of the 1,000 meetings recorded took place over a meal, the journal Physiology and Behavior reports. On these occasions participants felt happier and more relaxed, whether at home, at work or elsewhere. They felt friendlier, listened more, gave more compliments and were more likely to make compromises. They also believed that the person they were with was warmer and more likeable. And hierarchies broke down between bosses and employees and adults and children. One possible explanation is that chewing raises levels of the ‘feel-good’ brain chemical serotonin. Food for thought: The study found that people can talk about tricky subjects far easier over a meal . It is also possible that shared meals enhance our inbuilt desire to be accepted and to please others. Marije aan het Rot, of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, said that tricky topics might be best tackled over a meal. Bosses and employees and also parents and children, might all find it easier to get on at the table while dinner may not be the best idea for a first date. Dr Rot said the people in her study knew each other and the effect of a sharing a meal might be different among strangers. Apart from anything else, meals can be lengthy and people meeting for the first time might struggle to come up with enough conversation.","Dutch and Canadian study looked at 100 men and women .

3529,65cafde01954d1cb410deb9f6e9f9a724fd59fc1,"A rare insight into Manchester United's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club. The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening £800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . • Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . • The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . • Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . • The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . • Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . • The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres – on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for £80m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'.

And research shows that if your tip is seventh down the list or the jockey's racing colours are Royal blue, emerald green or red, then you're more likely to return to the bookies and collect a few bob. The world's greatest steeplechase takes place on Saturday at Aintree, which will be watched by a worldwide audience of 600 million with an estimated £500 million being staked globally by punters. Scroll down for video . Four out of ten Britons betting on the Grand National won last year by Pineau De Re, centre, make their choice purely down to the name of the horse while 70 per cent of women admit relying on pot luck . Jockey Sam Twiston Davies, pictured, admitted that he always salutes a magpie on his way to Aintree . Out of 2,000 Britons who confirmed they would be having a bet, 40 per cent of them admitted their selection would be purely down to the name of the horse because it would have struck a chord. A surprising 60 per cent said their secret superstition was to have the same family members gathered around the TV watching the race every year. Others revealed they sit in the same chair and have exactly the same food and drink during the race every time – and even wear the same 'lucky' clothes! When it comes to the big day, the survey – by National sponsors Crabbie's Alcoholic Ginger Beer – showed that a huge 70 per cent of women simply rely on pure chance opposed to 47-per cent of men who try to study form. But, to the bookies' glee, less than 20 per cent of those quizzed said their quirky superstitions actually produced a win. Survey boss Al Cross said: 'It seems most people have some sort of good luck charm. My own ritual is to always pick the well turned-out horse. It's worked for me twice, but I will keep trying.' And leading jump jockey Sam Twiston-Davies added: 'I only have one race ritual, and that is always to salute a magpie!'

He played under Louis van Gaal in Brazil and will face his former international boss when Villa travel to Old Trafford on Saturday. The 30-year-old is out of contract in the summer and, having shaken off a calf injury, Villa boss Sherwood wants Vlaar to rediscover his spark. He said: 'We all know what he has done over the years but when people are putting their hands in their pockets to fork out money, they want to know they are getting value. 'He was right up there with the best at the World Cup but people have short memories. 'You are always looking at what people are doing now rather than a few months ago. 'He will have far more options open to him if he is in the shop window that's for sure.' Vlaar has only made 12 Barclays Premier League starts this season following calf and knee problems as Villa, three points above the relegation zone, battle the drop. His last game in February saw him concede a stoppage-time penalty and get sent off as Villa lost 2-1 to Stoke in Sherwood's first match. And Sherwood has put any contract talks on hold with Vlaar in order to focus on keeping Villa in the top flight. 'He realises he needs to be playing. I haven't even bothered speaking to him. There's time for that when we are safe,' he said. 'He is just concentrating on getting fit to play. Without getting on the pitch, he's not going to be an attractive proposition to anybody.'

We had people here from France, Russia and Canada - they joined in because they could see our pain,’ event organiser Jan Kerr said. ‘It was magic to see.’ Orange resident Mark Andrew, who travelled to Canowindra on Sunday to pay his respects to the murdered teacher said it was a beautiful opportunity to honour Ms Scott. 'It was a surreal start to a sad and poignant day,' Mr Andrew told Daily Mail Australia. 'The only sounds were those of the burners on the balloons as they prepared to take off. The moment of take off was quite profoundly emotional. 'The silent gathering was akin to that at the ANZAC dawn service which is topical.' Scroll down for video . More than a dozen hot-air balloons took to the skies in Stephanie Scott's hometown Canowindra on Sunday morning . The town paid tribute to the much-loved teacher by filling the sky with brightly coloured hot-air balloons and smaller yellow balloons . The latest tribute comes just one week after Ms Scott was murdered and dumped in bushland six days before she was due to walk down the aisle to marry her partner of five years. Family and friends of the pair had flown from around the world to attend their big day, but are now bracing themselves to attend her funeral. Efforts to find out exactly what happened to Stephanie are continuing with forensic specialists expected to carry out a post-mortem on the body on Monday. The burned remains were found by police just five metres from a road in the Cocoparra National Park in the NSW Riverina region at about 5pm on Friday.

NSW police are reportedly expected to make inquiries with their counterparts in the Netherlands as part of their investigation into Stephanie's death.

Build-time pressure over the winter resulted in the Silverstone-based marque starting the campaign with a car that is considerably off the pace. The additional knock-on effect means a delay in the introduction of the team's B-spec model, which is now not due to be unveiled until the Austrian Grand Prix in June. Sergio Perez walks through the paddock in Shanghai ahead of Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix . Perez locks his brakes on his way to 10th place finish in the Australian Grand Prix in March . The hope is Perez and team-mate Nico Hulkenberg will then finally be able to compete for points finishes, rather than crossing fingers a top-10 spot comes their way via reliability issues for their rivals. If performance is lacking, however, Perez fears the worst. 'We're hoping to make a big step forward,' said Perez. 'If we make that step then we can still have a good year as there will be plenty of races remaining, a lot of time to recover. 'But if we don't make the step we're hoping for then it's going to be a very painful year.' For the team and the Mexican, who was 10th in the season-opening race in Australia - where only 15 started and 11 finished - and 13th in Malaysia recently, the current struggles are already tough to endure. Perez fears for Force India's pace and was hounded by the equally troubled McLaren duo of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button in the Malaysia Grand Prix near the back of the grid . Perez finished 13th at Sepang and admits Force India are relying on their June upgrade to come good . 'It is frustrating knowing we don't have a competitive car that can take us into the points on pure pace. It's really hard,' Perez added. 'It is also really hard to keep motivated. Going into a race, knowing it is going to be very hard without any advantage, is not the easiest for a driver. 'At the moment, on pure pace, it is quite difficult to make it into the points. We're quite far from the teams ahead of us. 'We are in a position where it's very easy to make mistakes, to lose the car as it is very difficult with degradation and stuff. 'From now on we are going to have hard races, but it is what it is at the moment. We have to be professional and do the job as if we are going to win the race.

The 21-year-old has begun the last day of the hallowed tournament after setting a scoring record for 54 holes of 16 under par. He is playing alongside British contender Justin Rose in the final, showcase pairing, and will be looking to avoid the disappointment of last year, when he finished runner-up. Some of his American rivals, such as Tiger Woods, have slipped down the leaderboard. But others, including Dustin Johnson and Phil Mickelson are still posing a threat. Jordan Speith, pictured during his final round on Sunday, is in prime position to win The Masters, taking a four shot lead into the final round at Augusta . He is playing with British contender Justin Rose, who began the day four shots off the pace . Spieth, who squandered a front-nine Masters lead on Sunday last year and settled for sharing second behind Bubba Watson, is the man to beat for the top prize of $1.8 million at the $10 million event. 'Last year definitely left a bad taste in my mouth,' Spieth said. 'Looking at trying to get some revenge. I've got a long way to go still.' The spotlight belonged to Spieth, who could break Tiger Woods' 1997 tournament record of 18-under 270 by shooting 69 in the final round. The former world number one Woods started the day some shots back, and caused concern on the 7th hole when he seemed to injure his finger. He then pulled up on the 8th tee, shaking off the same hand while his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn watched from the crowds. If he wins, Spieth would become the second-youngest winner in Masters history, five months older than Woods when he won his first major in 1997. Spieth could also become only the fifth wire-to-wire winner in Masters history, joining Craig Wood in 1941, Arnold Palmer in 1960, Jack Nicklaus in 1972 and Ray Floyud in 1976. Spieth is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds, but Norman squandered a six-stroke lead in making the greatest last-day collapse in major golf history and lost by five to Nick Faldo. Tiger Woods  waits to play a shot on the first hole during the final round. He started the day further down the field looking to make up lost ground .

His girlfriend, gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn, was spotted walking up the first way as he got his round underway . She has been on hand to support her beau at Augusta throughout the week . No player in Masters history has ever reached 19-under at any stage of the tournament but Spieth flirted with it Saturday, making four birdies in five holes to stand 18-under before a double bogey at 17 and a 10-foot par save at 18, and could threaten again Sunday. With 22 birdies through 54 holes, Spieth broke Woods' record of 21 in 2005 and is on pace to shatter Mickelson's Masters 72-hole birdie total record of 25 from 2001. But Spieth has not made the Masters a runaway. Rose, who closed with five birdies in the last six holes Saturday, is trying for a second major crown - 22 months after his breakthrough at Merion. And Mickelson is still in position to potentially become the second-oldest winner in Masters history after Jack Nicklaus, who was 46 when he won in 1986. Mickelson has only one top-10 in his past 31 starts but it was a runner-up effort at last year's PGA Championship. Mickelson won the 2004, 2006 and 2010 Masters, as well as the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 British Open. Should he win Sunday, he would match Faldo and Lee Trevino as six-time major champions. Spieth (above with girlfriend Annie Verret on her 21st birthday) is the first player since Greg Norman in 1996 to own the outright Masters lead after each of the first three rounds . On Saturday it was reported that the Dallas, Texas native has just bought $2.3million on a stunning Texas mansion and has a gorgeous girlfriend, Annie Verret, who also happens to be his high school sweetheart. Spieth grew up the oldest of three siblings to Shawn and Chris Spieth. Steven, Spieth's younger brother, is an athlete as well, and plays basketball for Brown University. Then there is his youngest sibling Ellie, who was born with a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum, and who has played the biggest role in shaping her brother's career according to Spieth's mother. She says Ellie helps the young superstar stay so grounded. 'Jordan wouldn't be where he's at today if he didn't grow up with Ellie,' said Mrs. Spieth in an interview with ESPN. 'Jordan realizes this isn't real life at the Masters. Trying to sit around and have dinner when his sister doesn't want to eat when everybody else is eating and has a fit, that's real life.'

The victims were lured to Britain but were 'treated like dogs' - being made to urinate in buckets and live and eat outside in winter, prosecutors say. The jury heard how the workers were kept under duress amid fears for the safety of their families back home and sent to work in dog food factories, food plants and car washes in Plymouth, Devon. But they were made to give over all their wages, forced to eat outside during the winter and do housework to pay off 'loans' for their board and passage, a jury heard. Accused: Petr Tancos (left) and sister Ruzena Tancosova (right) are on trial for people trafficking in Plymouth . The allegations of their shocking treatment were made during a trial of five family members at Plymouth Crown Court. Ruzena Tancosova, 34, brother Petr Tancos, 35, cousin Martin Tancos, 35, Nela Dzurkova, 26, and Katerina Kurejova, 35, all of Plymouth, are charged with people trafficking. All deny the charges. Police say victims would be threatened with violence by the gang who pocketed their wages and benefits - believed to be around £150,000 - and even made them shoplift. Malcolm Galloway, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said the five defendants, all members of an extended Czech Roma family, brought the immigrants over. He said a neighbour also saw one standing by and directing one of the men to cut grass with a kitchen knife. He said: 'These defendants entered into a criminal agreement to traffick other Czech nationals into the UK and then exploit them for financial benefit.' Mr Galloway said: 'They (the immigrants) came with a promise of good pay, a job and a future.' Mr Galloway said the family used various methods to exploit the men - including for example putting a notice on the toilet door charging £1 for its use. But the court heard that the men were also threatened with violence if they failed to comply. He said: 'They would put them up in their houses in Plymouth. The Czech nationals would sometimes have to sleep on the floor, outside in the garage. 'They would have to urinate in buckets and eat outside.' He added that police started surveillance after two immigrants went to the authorities. Officers then searched their properties on September 16 last year. The court heard one man, Josef Bukovinsky, told police he had been 'living with the gypsies' in the Czech Republic before he was 'sold to Ruzena' (Tancosova). On trial: Nela Dzurkova (left) and Katerina Kurejova (right) are part of a Roma family accused of illegally trafficking Czech migrants into the UK and 'treating them like dogs' Mr Galloway said he was one of 11 men who lived with Tancosova in less than three years at a former address in Plymouth. All five defendants are charged with conspiracy to traffic individuals into the country for the purpose of exploitation between April 6, 2013, and September 16, 2014. Tancosova, Petr Tancos and Dzurkova are also charged with the same offence again but applying to an earlier period between January 1, 2010, and April 5, 2013. Tancosova and Martin Tancos are further accused of acting as gangmasters in supplying workers to pack agricultural products. Tancosova and Petr Tancos also allegedly required a person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2014. Mr Galloway told the trial that Tancos was seen by neighbours at different addresses to supervise the immigrants. He said a neighbour of Tancos and partner and co-defendant Nela Dzurkova spotted three men apparently living in their garage. The woman told police she saw Dzurkova passing food out of the kitchen window to men who stood in the garden of the house eating from trays in winter. He said: 'She also saw Petr Tancos standing by and directing one of the men to cut the grass with a kitchen knife.' He said the man was on his hands and knees. Mr Galloway said the neighbour noticed that Petr Tancos encouraged his children to throw stones at the men. She estimated that between 10 and 12 men lived at the home at different times. Mr Galloway said another immigrant, Miroslav Ritter, stayed with Petr Tancos and Dzurkova at their last address. He added: 'He slept, in his words, like a dog under the window in the living room, in a gap between the table and window. 'He slept on the carpet with a blanket and a pillow.' Jan Banyak told police he stayed at the home of Martin Tancos and Kurejova and £600 a month in rent to sleep on the kitchen floor. Mr Banyak believed that he earned about £250 a week working in a factory, but he did not know where the money went. He only received about £10 from Martin Tancos. Mr Galloway said: 'He told the police they usually had to eat outside. There were 10 of them and Katerina Kurejova did not want them inside as there were only two rooms. They eat mostly tinned food.' He added that when police raided the address, they found two other men sleeping on mattresses, under the stairs and in the kitchen. Mr Galloway said Tancosova, who had four bank accounts, pocketed £86,517 in benefits over four years and eight months. He added: 'The credit turnover for the accounts, including benefit payments, amounted to £148,923.' Mr Galloway said police had not been able to trace everyone they suspected of staying at the rented homes of the family. The trial continues.

The 21-year-old shared a photo on Instagram of her soaking up the sun with two friends and captioned the image 'Country music is the best music #tortuga.' In recent weeks, Robson has been stepping up her attempts at getting back on the tennis court after a lengthy absence. Laura Robson (centre) shared a picture on Instagram of her at Tortuga festival with two friends . Robson's last appearance came in the 2014 Australian Open first round where she lost in straight sets . Robson (left) had to wear a protective cast last year but tweeted a picture back on the court last month . Her last appearance was over a year ago, in the first round of the 2014 Australian Open, where she was swept aside in straight sets by Kirtsen Flipkens and she has not played since due to a left wrist problem. She had tendon surgery  and is now nearing a return, although she withdrew from a qualifying event for the Miami Open last month and also removed her name from a WTA Tour event in Bogota later in April. It appears her next target with be the French Open, with the first round starting on Sunday, May 24. Should she make it out on the clay at Roland Garros, it will end a 16-month absence from the court that has left one of Britain's brightest hopes in women's tennis without a world ranking. She has been practising in the United States, in Tampa, as she aims to build up form and fitness. A previous Instagram post on March 26, of her doing a handstand on a tennis court to show off her new shoes, showed supporters she was back training and the strength in her wrist was returning. Her manager, Max Eisenbud, gave an update on her progress at the end of March and sounded cautiously optimistic about how Robson is improving. Robson is now said to be nearing a return and is  targeting the French Open in May . The 21-year-old Robson also missed out on Wimbledon last year but could be in line to play in 2015 . 'I’m happy with the way it’s been going and she’s been hitting the ball great in practice,' Eisenbud said. 'It’s a question of waiting until the coaches think she can play five matches in a week. 'It’s all about when she is ready to compete. We don’t want to put her in a situation where she can’t play a full tournament.'","Laura Robson has not played since January 2014 due to a wrist problem .

7990,f60570b57867a61c087114a4cc9a3859175ed2eb,"Technology: A study found that the majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job . A generation of older workers are risking redundancy and long-term unemployment because of poor technology skills, it is claimed. Experts said training was ‘heavily geared’ towards young people, meaning many older workers were left behind in the workplace. This left them vulnerable when companies start ‘shedding’ jobs. While older generations often pride themselves on their numeracy and literacy skills, even these could ‘go stale’ with age, a study warned. The Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) said research showed that over-55s had the same literacy and numeracy skills as those aged 16 to 24 – and were worse at these skills than colleagues in their 30s and 40s. The AAT said the death of a ‘job for life’ meant workers could no longer rely on loyalty to their company and experience to take them through to retirement with the same employer. Instead, older workers could not become complacent and must constantly ‘reskill’ and retrain to boost their job security, it said. In a new report on the value of training for older workers, it said: ‘The old model of training in youth and a ""career for life"" thereafter no longer applies’. A survey by the AAT found that, while people in their twenties, thirties and forties aspired to take a master’s degree in the future or a vocational qualification, this stopped at 55, when most respondents said they were unlikely to undertake a formal qualification. A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification. The majority of older workers did not believe better computer skills would help them in their current job, while an astonishing one in 10 have never used a computer. But the AAT said the reality was they may have a ‘lack of knowledge of what modern and technological tools there are available which could assist them carrying out their tasks’. Education: A third of over-55s cited their age as the reason for not wanting to take a new qualification . Mark Farrar, of the AAT, said: ‘Older generations are faced with the greatest barriers when it comes to reskilling. ‘Given rapid economic and technological changes, many traditional jobs are less secure than in the past and older workers are increasingly facing the threat of redundancy. ‘The UK’s ageing population is growing and the increased retirement age means people are working for longer. ‘The challenge is therefore to ensure people can continue to participate in the labour market at the later stage of their working lives.’ According to the Office for National Statistics, workers aged 55 and over are less likely to be unemployed than younger workers. But older unemployed people are more likely to have been out of work for 12 months or longer, suggesting they find it harder to find a new job if they do find themselves out of work. The accountancy body said older men were particularly vulnerable to job losses in the declining mining, agriculture and manufacturing industries, while women were heavily over-represented in the public sector so could face risks from cuts to civil servants.","Experts say older workers are left behind in workplace because of training .

As United kicked off their Premier League season with a match against  Swansea in August, Young received a surprise delivery from a bird mid-match, much to the amusement of his team-mates, who took advantage of the situation. Speaking exclusively to Match of the Day magazine, Shaw said: 'Ashley Young is the joker in the dressing room. We still laugh about the time he got bird poo in his mouth against Swansea. Manchester United left back Luke Shaw (second left) trains at the club's Aon Complex on Friday . Shaw admits that Ashley Young is the biggest joker in the Manchester United dressing room . He says the players still laugh at the time Young got bird poo in his mouth during a match against Swansea . 'If you ask him now, he'll say it wasn't bird poo. In the changing room we hung a fake bird above his place as a joke which he didn't like.' Shaw's revelations come as he nears the end of his first season at Old Trafford. His transition from Southampton star to £31.5million United man has been more difficult than he would have liked, with the left back making just 17 appearances this season. He has suffered a number of injuries, limiting his time on the pitch, but still appears to have settled into his new surroundings well. He admits he picks up tips from goalkeeper David de Gea, who has been in impressive form on the pitch for Louis van Gaal's side. According to Shaw, he is not just a top goalkeeper, but is approachable off the pitch when players need advice too. According to Shaw, United goalkeeper David de Gea is the 'nicest guy in football' and is always approachable . Louis van Gaal's stern demeanour is not limited to the touchline; at training he is equally as focused . Shaw has struggled with a number of injuries since arriving at Manchester United from Southampton . 'David de Gea is funny, he’s kind, if you want to talk to him you can talk to him – he’s the nicest guy in football! 'He’s been unbelievable for us this season and kept us in so many games, he’s starting to become the best goalkeeper in the world.” 'We’ve got a few Spanish-speaking players and they’re always playing their music and dancing around – the English lads hate it. Sometimes we can’t understand them, they say stuff to us and we’re like ‘What?’” After a disappointing campaign under David Moyes last season, Shaw's arrival coincided with that of Van Gaal, who has turned things around at Old Trafford. Now, United look certain to be heading towards a top-four finish, and Shaw admits that Van Gaal's pitch-side focus isn't limited to match-days; at training he is just as stern. 'The manager is always focused on his job, and his job is to win games. I haven’t seen a cheeky side to him yet, but you could say he has one. 'When we’re on the training pitch it’s like a game day, 100 per cent focus, nothing will change his mind or his focus, he’s always on the ball.'

Wet and cloudy weather was to blame in Sydney, where the Sydney Observatory said the short lunar began at 10.58pm (AEDT) and finished at 11.03pm. 'Our live feed from Griffith Observatory is showing gorgeous totality pink!' observatory staff wrote on Twitter at about 11pm, accompanying their tweet with a picture of equipment showing off the bright pink moon. Scroll down for video . The lunar eclipse as seen from Melbourne on Easter Saturday, April 4. A total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon is completely in the Earth's shadow . Wet and cloudy weather was to blame for Sydneysiders missing out on the view, but the Sydney Observatory captured every moment with their equipment . Brisbane was also predicted to miss out due to bad weather, but the moon was pictured revealing itself through rain clouds towards the end of a total lunar eclipse . The beginning of the eclipse was captured from behind leaves illuminated by a street light in Canberra on Saturday . 'It's highly likely that it will still be cloudy,' The Bureau of Meteorology's Chris Webb had said of Sydney, adding that a break in the clouds at precisely the right moment could still present a slim chance for hopeful sky gazers. Brisbane, Darwin, Canberra and Hobart residents were also promised slim chance of viewing the phenomenon due to poor weather conditions, but clear night skies were predicted for Adelaide, Melbourne and Perth. Those faced with bad weather may not have missed out on much however, with the event being one of the shortest lunar eclipses of the century. 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592,' Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith told the ABC earlier. Despite rain and clouds predicted to obscure the event for Canberrians, this image was taken of the full moon behind clouds on Saturday night .

Residents of Auckland in New Zealand also had a spectacular view of the 'blood moon' A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the edge of the earth's shadow. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it appears red. The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. Part of the lunar eclipse is seen behind fully bloomed cherry blossoms in Utsunomiya in Tochigi prefecture, 100km north of Tokyo on April 4 .

A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes in the shadow of Earth. This is an area known as the umbra, where light from the Sun is blocked by our planet. The light refracts differently in the atmosphere and, as it hits the moon, it makes it appear red. This gives rise to its 'blood red' appearance during a total eclipse, when the entire moon is in shadow. If it skirts the shadow, known as a partial or penumbral eclipse, the effect is less dramatic. Simon Allen, BOM's senior meteorologist, told the ABC that Adelaide would have the clearest skies out of all the states - where the partial eclipse began at 8.45pm and the peak at 10:30pm. In Brisbane, cloudy conditions and showers were forecast, denting the chances of seeing the eclipse. There was no rain in Melbourne, where an uninterrupted view of the lunar event began at 9:15pm and peaked at 11pm. Less positive wass the forecast for Hobart, which was for clouds and a 20 per cent chance of rain. The same was also expected in Canberra and a late storm was due in Darwin, however the former managed to clear up enough for some to see the lunar show. Those who miss out will have to wait until January 31, 2018, for the next lunar eclipse visible from Australia. As did the Echo Park district of Los Angeles.

But now, nearly eight months after his passing, the young Oklahoma family has been reunited in their first ever family portrait, thanks to some clever photoshopping by a local photographer. Kayli Henley was snapping pictures of six-month-old Taos and his 20-year-old mother, Sierra Sharry, when the young mom asked the photographer if she could make their family complete. So Henley took a photograph of Smith from the family and, with a ghostly filter, fitted the image around his girlfriend and son, as if he were standing over them. Scroll down for video . Family portrait: A photoshopped image shows Sierra Sharry holding her six-month-old son Taos with her boyfriend, the baby's father, Lane Smith, standing behind them. Smith passed away before his son's birth . Sharry called the ghostly final picture 'amazing'. 'Lane's not physically here with us, of course, but that picture represents to us that he is always watching over us and he will always be there for us no matter what,' she told KOCO. After sharing the image to her Facebook page, the photographer found that other people thought the image was amazing too. It has been liked more than 200,000 times and shared more than 25,000 times, and Henley has been inundated with requests to create other pictures for families who have lost a loved one. In a post shared on the Facebook page, Sharry explained that in July 2014, she and 26-year-old Smith had been nervous about the impending birth of their son. 'We were scared as any new parents would be but ready for the adventure together,' she said. Excitement: 26-year-old Lane Smith, pictured with his girlfriend in the couple's pregnancy announcement, died after hitting his head in an accident in July 2014. His son was born just a few weeks later . When she was around eight months pregnant, they went to jet boat races in El Reno, she recalled. But the weather was too warm for Sharry, so she left her boyfriend there with his family. 'When I left Lane that day I had no clue it would be the last time I'd see him,' she wrote. But in the early hours of the next day, she awoke to a call that Smith had been rushed to the OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City after he had fallen and hit his head. She and her mother raced to his side. They never considered his injuries could be life-threatening, but once they got there, they were given 'absolutely no hope that Lane was going to make it'. 'July 13th 2014 was the absolute worst day of my life,' she explained. 'I lost my best friend. The father of my unborn child. And since that day I have felt so empty inside. A part of me will forever be missing. I loved that man more than life itself.' Strong: Sharry said that part of her has been missing since the death of Taos' father but that the photograph allowed her to see her complete family for the first time. She is pictured in another image from the shoot . Missed: She said she knows that Smith, pictured left, will always be watching over her and their son, right . Their son was born just a few weeks later and when he approached six months, Sharry asked Henley, who is baked in Yukon, if she'd be able to put together a family photo. 'I just got to thinking, we don't have a picture with Lane in it,' Sharry explained to KOCO. So Rene created the photo that has since been shared thousands of times online. 'It brought me to tears,' Sharry wrote about the photograph. 'This is how I picture us. Taos and I living our lives the best we can with Lane ALWAYS watching over our shoulder.' Rene said she was happy to be able to help. 'As soon as I met Taos, he had a smile that was so contagious, the happiest baby boy, and he instantly captured my heart,' she said on her Facebook page. '[I] never knew if I could make this reality for them. So glad I could and they can cherish this forever.'","Lane Smith died after falling and hitting his head in July 2014 - just a few weeks before his girlfriend, Sierra Sharry, gave birth to their son, Taos .

So much so that battle plans would be drawn up to specifically give the castle at Zhangjiakou, in China's northern Hebei province, a wide berth. Now archaeologists have begun a daunting project to restore the once-mighty site to something approaching it previous glory, in particular the dilapidated outer wall that repelled every attack which invading Mongolian armies could throw at it. Among the works being carried out at Wanquan Castle is the restoration of the fortress' dilapidated outer wall . Workers restore the southern barbican entrance to Wanquan Castle, which was known as the Ming Dynasty's 'Martial City' The fortress was built in 1393 and managed to repel all attacks by the invading Mongolian armies . The fortress measures some two kilometres in circumference and was protected by an imposing 12-metre wall . The restoration of the fortress - which was given the coveted title of 'Wucheng' or 'Martial City' after its construction in 1393 - will see building work completed in the original Ming Dynasty style of architecture, reports People's Daily Online. The project will see the restoration of the Ming and Qing era commercial districts, the Great Wall Martial Museum, the Golden Harvest Academy and performance theatres as well as the opening of the Red Tourist Route, with all work planned to be complete in 2016. The restoration work will also include the ongoing protection of surviving structures. The castle in Wanquan county - known in China as a 'living fossil of the Ming military system' - was built in 1393 but is relatively well-preserved, especially the interior city area which includes the residences of generals and wealthy merchants. The fortress has huge historical, cultural and military significance and has key cultural relic status in China. While much of the interior city is in good condition, the outer wall is somewhat dilapidated and will be the focus of much of the work . The restoration work, which is due to be completed next year, will where possible be carried out in the style of Ming Dynasty architecture . The Ming Dynasty ruled China for 276 years, between the years 1368 and 1644, and is often described as the last of the great Chinese dynasties. During the era large scale architectural and civil engineering projects were created or expanded, including the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canal and the Forbidden City, located in Beijing. It took 15 years to build, using more than one million workers, and has almost 1,000 buildings. Art flourished during the Ming Dynasty, which saw an explosion of literature, painting, poetry, music and porcelain - with Ming vases and plates valuable collector items to this day. Following popular uprising and rebellions across China, the Chinese army was defeated and the Ming Dynasty collapsed when its last emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City, in 1644.

Robert Charles Bates shot and killed Eric Courtney Harris as the younger man was trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a dollar store. Harris, 44, was being restrained by one of the undercover police officers when Bates, who was monitoring from afar, ran up 'trying to get the situation under control' and fired one shot. According to police at the scene in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bates, a former full-time officer, accidentally pulled out his service weapon instead of the stun gun. Confusion: Robert Charles Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot a man dead, it has been claimed . Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control, inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. He also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition and ran when deputies tried to arrest him, then fought with another deputy when he was shot. Killed: Eric Harris, 44, was allegedly meeting with undercover deputies to buy a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol . He was gunned down after officers 'observed him reaching for his waistband area ... causing concern for the deputies' safety,' CNN reported. Officers had been monitoring Harris as part of an investigation into the trade of methamphetamine. As he met with undercover deputies to allegedly hand over the drugs, he is accused of offering to throw in a sawed-off gun. His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons.

The Miami-Dade Police Department set up a hidden camera to deal with the ongoing problem of luggage theft, and found workers rifling through checked bags both before they were loaded onto planes and once inside the aircraft's belly. This as it is revealed that airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014. Scroll down for video . Police also caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport (above) stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera . A baggage handler (above) at JFK Airport in New York was also caught on camera going through a passenger's wallet . CNN reports that 31 employees have been arrested for theft in Miami since 2012, including six this year. Incidents of theft at that airport are far less however that New York's John F. Kennedy, which has more claims of lost property that anywhere else in the country. In 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera at that airport, and found workers stealing cash, jewelry, iPhones and iPads, which led to six arrests. Across the country in Los Angeles, 16 airport workers were fired last year after police obtained search warrants for their homes following a increase in reported thefts at the terminal where they were employed. 'We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,' said Patrick Gannon, the police chief at that airport. Overall, there have been 30,621 claims of missing valuables since 2010, with most of these coming from checked luggage. Of those claims, 2,493 occurred at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 (above a JFK employee) Most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal, with only Orlando and Miami screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only Miami screening them when they leave. Since 2002, the TSA has fired 513 workers for theft, though it is now known how many of them faced criminal charges. Gannon believes that theft is not the only problem either, as it could lead to bigger threats in the nation's airports. 'I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism.'","Police caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera .

The waitress told the New Zealand Herald that she published the details of John Key's behaviour, which she experienced while she was working at a cafe in Auckland, as she 'expected more from him' and wanted 'the public to be aware'. The 26-year-old, an employee at Rosie cafe which is frequented by Mr Key and his wife, recounted on The Daily Blog how the Prime Minister kept playfully pulling her hair despite being told to stop during election time last year. But following the publication of the blog on Wednesday, Mr Key defended his pranks as 'a bit of banter' and said he had already apologised for his actions, Stuff.co.nz reports. Scroll down for video . Amanda Bailey (right) with Jackie Grant and Scott Brown, whose company Hip Group owns Rosie cafe in Auckland where Ms Bailey works.

A waitress has revealed how the New Zealand Prime Minister had repeatedly given her unwanted attention while she was working at a cafe in Auckland frequented by him and his wife Bronagh (pictured together) Ms Bailey told the Herald that she felt Mr Key's behaviour was inappropriate. 'I didn't feel I should have to put up with that,' she said. 'I expected more from him and I want the public to be aware. 'John Key feels he is untouchable.'

'He was like the school yard bully tugging on the little girls' hair trying to get a reaction, experiencing that feeling of power over her,' she wrote. Mr Key kept being persistent with his hair-pulling antics, despite being told by his wife Bronagh to stop. After dealing with the practical jokes over the six months he had visited the cafe, the waitress finally lost her cool.

I felt powerless and tormented and I stepped out the back and I cried frustrated tears.' Key, who was en route to the Anzac ceremony in Gallipoli on Wednesday, told reporters he has a very 'warm and friendly relationship' with staff at the cafe. 'When I realised she took offence by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologised and said I was terribly sorry,' he said according to Stuff.co.nz. 'It was all in the context of a bit of banter that was going on, and so obviously I immediately apologised for that. 'She thanked me for that and said ""that's all fine, no drama"".'

Dr George Hamilton, the Chief Apostle of the W.O.R.D. Ministries in Summerville, South Carolina, launched an attack on officer Michael Slager, who killed Scott last week by shooting him five times in the back, referring to him as a 'disgrace'. Hundreds of mourners were crammed inside the small church today, where Scott's casket, draped in an American flag, was led in, accompanied by his distraught mother. The family had a police escort to the funeral. Hamilton continued to rail against Slager, who has been jailed and charged with Scott's murder, during the service. Referring to the cell phone video which shows Scott being gunned down as he tried to run from Slager, he said: 'It's one thing to have a loved one die... It's another to have to watch them die... and see how they died'. Scroll down for videos .

Mother: Judy Scott is pictured getting out of a black limousine at the funeral service for Scott, a 50-year-old father of four . According to ABC News, he continued: 'Walter's death was motivated by racial discrimination. You've got to hate somebody to shoot them in the back. 'This officer is a disgrace to the North Charleston Police Department... You don't tase a man and then shoot him.A badge is not authority to murder.' Hamilton did add that Slager's actions were not representative of all law enforcement, insisting 'We will not indict the entire law enforcement for the act of one racist'. Judy Scott, Walter's mother, was among the hundreds of mourners at the service today, arriving with other family members in a fleet of black limousines to the service for Scott, 50, who was a father of four. Scott, a former coast guard, had been married twice and was engaged to be married to a third woman before he was pulled over for a broken tail light by Slager, who shot him five times in the back after a confrontation in North Charleston. So many people came to the service that hundreds were left waiting outside. U.S. senator Tim Scott (R-SC), Congressman Jim Clyburn (D-SC), state senator Marlon Kimpson, Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon, and Elder James Johnson of the National Action Network all attended. After the funeral Rep. Clyburn, said he wanted national strategies and standards for law enforcement to be considered. Referring to the suggestion that officers be made to wear body-mounted cameras, he said: 'Body cameras are a good start. They're certainly not a panacea'. In an obituary Scott's family focused on his love for his friends and family, devotion to God, and appreciation for the Dallas Cowboys. At a wake yesterday his casket had also been adorned with Cowboys memorabilia. The obituary said: 'Walter was born in February 9, 1965 native of Charleston, SC area. He attended the Charleston County School System. He proudly served his country by enlisting in the National Coast Guard in 1984 where he was stationed in Baltimore, Maryland. 'He received his massage therapist degree from Miller Motte in 2006. He leaves to mourn loving parents, Elder Walter and Minister Judy G Scott, two brothers Anthony N. Scott and Rodney E.

'Walter loved the Lord; and he expressed it by singing in the choir. He loved all of his family and friends and often embraced others as family. He was a true fan of the Dallas Cowboys.' Scott worked as a forklift truck driver and had served in the Coast Guard in the 1980s. Police escorted a hearse headed towards W.O.R.D. Ministries in Summerville, South Carolina. Mourners waited through light rain as flowers were unloaded and taken to the sanctuary. His family, with a police escort, arrived at the church around 11am in a fleet of three black limousines. Dozens of mourners who were lined up outside the church held up their cellphones trying to capture the scene as Scott's casket was unloaded from the hearse and wheeled into the church.

Local dignitaries: U.S. Representative Jim Clyburn (left, D-SC) attended the funeral, as did Charleston County Sheriff Al Cannon (right) Embrace: Two funeral attendees embrace in the rain during the funeral for Scott, held a week after he was shot dead . Tributes: Men carry flowers into the church where Scott's service is being held today. An obituary praised his loving nature and generosity towards family and friends . Sadness: Mourners in Summerville leaned on one another ahead of the service for Scott, who has four children aged 16-24 . The family said they decided to keep the press away after the New York Daily News reported that they had banned Al Sharpton from the funeral - a claim the family and Sharpton have refuted. A wake for Scott was held yesterday, at which his open casket was on display and adorned with Dallas Cowboys memorabilia. At the time he was stopped, Scott owed some $18,000 in child support payments, which family said may have been why he tried to run from Slager. His brother, Rodney Scott, said: 'He had trouble keeping up with the payments, that's all, and he knew he would go to jail. 'His mission was to avoid the police as much as possible.' Dash cam video from Slager's patrol car has shown him pulling over Scott, who got out of his car and ran while the officer's back was turned. Court records show Scott last paid child support in 2012 and a bench warrant for his arrest was issued in early 2013. Scott had been in jail three times since 2008. Rodney Scott said his brother would take long detours while driving to their parents' house because he thought there were more police patrolling the direct, 10-minute route from his home. He said Walter also tried to make sure any vehicle he drove had working headlights and taillights. Some of the city's black residents have told similar stories about being stopped by police over minor infractions or simply avoiding police altogether. Killing: Scott was gunned down as he ran away from Sager, who has since been charged with his murder . Killing: Walter Scott, left, was killed by Michael Slager, right. Scott was in the Coast Guard for two years, and is pictured left in uniform. Slager is being held in jail on murder charges, and is pictured right in his prison mugshot . It emerged yesterday that Scott had also been jailed in 1987 on a charge of assault and battery. A report released by the Charleston County Sheriff's Department on Friday said they had to break up a fight between Scott and another man, during which he shoved a deputy to the floor. Despite Scott's record, those who knew him remember Scott as lighthearted and gentle. They describe a laid-back, fun-loving man who took his girlfriend dancing on weekends, entertained family and friends with backyard cookouts and hosted regular domino games. 'This is a long time coming, but now that it has come all of those things have to be recognized. It's so sad that it happened like that because a lot of this stuff has been on the backburner for a long time,' Ernest Murray, 73, said during Scott's wake. 'He wouldn't hurt a fly, man,' said Ronald Smith, 29, a co-worker who often got advice on marriage and other life decisions from Scott when the older man gave him a lift home after their shift. 'All of us looked up to him.'","Service for Scott, 50, in Summerville, South Carolina, was attended by hundreds of mourners .

11086,0953a85cee13aba3aebad5a7f625349e9a848679,"Salads in British supermarkets are being grown by workers treated like ‘slaves’ who live in filthy conditions, an investigation has found. Migrant workers producing vegetables exported to Britain say they are denied basic hygiene facilities while working and are forced to use bushes near where the vegetables are being grown as toilets. They are not provided with soap or water to wash their hands, while some live in filthy shacks made of wood and plastic sheeting near the fields in southern Spain. They claim they are treated like slaves by agencies who hire them to produce the salads and vegetables that end up on supermarket shelves in Britain, the investigation by Channel 4 News found. They also say they are made to work around dangerous pesticides – causing some to fall ill – and are routinely left unpaid for hours they have worked. The revelations will horrify millions of customers of British supermarkets, all of which tell consumers their food is produced ethically and that workers are treated fairly. And they will lead to claims that the bitter price war which has seen supermarkets slash prices in a bid to compete with discounters Aldi and Lidl has led to ruthless exploitation of the vulnerable. A firm that supplies salad and vegetables to Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda is among those accused of using mistreated workersSome workers say they have developed horrific sinus conditions and bronchitis as a result of being sprayed with the pesticides while producing the vegetables in the fields of Murcia. Cleaning: Some live in filthy shacks made of wood and plastic sheeting near the fields in Almeria southern Spain . Yesterday British politicians demanded an urgent investigation, saying the evidence was ‘appalling’ and appeared to show ‘effectively slave labour producing food in 2015’. Sainsbury’s and Waitrose said they would investigate immediately. All the major British supermarkets claim they source food responsibly. And they have all signed up to tough rules to promote workers’ rights under the global Ethical Trading Initiative, designed to protect labourers. The revelations centre on workers in Murcia and Almeria from where millions of pounds worth of vegetables are exported to the UK every year. Workers in one field in Murcia were filmed being sprayed with pesticides. One vegetable picker working for a firm in Almeria supplying courgettes to the UK told of the filthy conditions in which he was made to work. ‘For the toilet you have to go in the bushes,’ he said. ‘What is there to clean yourself? For these courgettes to reach England, there are workers who have suffered a lot.’ Growing trade: The workers say they have to work around dangerous pesticides - causing some to fall ill . He said workers at his company, based in Almeria, were also sprayed with pesticides but were too afraid to complain because their names would be put on a blacklist known as ‘the list of rotten sardines’. Lettuce: The revelations will lead to claims that the bitter supermarket price war has led to ruthless exploitation of the vulnerable . The investigation also uncovered concerns about workers for Agroherni, a Murcia firm which sells £22million worth of salad, herbs and vegetables a year to Britain’s major supermarkets including Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. It is not alleged that Agroherni's workers are forced to live  in dirty conditions or work without sanitation, but one former employee told how she had been left in agonising pain and needed multiple operations on her sinuses after working in fields where pesticides were being sprayed. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: ‘All that matters to them is fulfilling their clients’ orders.’ Agroherni uses an employment agency called Integra Empleo to provide workers to pick the produce in its fields, but the workers say the agency routinely denies them pay. One lettuce picker said: ‘If we work 26 days, they write down 16 or 18. They always steal seven or eight days.’ Last night Tory Richard Drax, a former member of the Environment and Rural Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘If true, these allegations are appalling. It sounds like effectively slave labour producing food in 2015 which is utterly unacceptable. ‘Supermarkets must explain themselves. It is up to them to know who is producing their food and in what conditions.’ Tory Neil Parish, a colleague on the committee, said: ‘There is always a price to pay for cheap imported food; whether it is poor quality, low animal welfare standards or, in this case, the appalling treatment of workers.’ More than 40 employment agencies supply labour to farm growers in the Murcia region. All the top supermarkets say they abide by the Ethical Trading Initiative. Tesco says it has local ethical trade managers on the ground who investigate claims locally. Bagged up: The revelations will horrify millions of customers of British supermarkets (file picture) But it is thought the companies who are major suppliers to the supermarkets get round the rules by using employment agencies who cut corners to save money. Both Agroherni and Integra Empleo deny all the allegations and say they have launched investigations into the claims. Probe: Sainsbury’s (pictured) and Waitrose said they would investigate the findings immediately . Agroherni said it maintains a strict procedure with regard to the use of pesticides and is not aware of any relevant incidents. It strongly denied that it mistreats or exploits agency workers and said the fair treatment and safety of workers was paramount. However as a result of the Channel 4 News investigation it has ceased working with Integra Empleo and is to employ the workers directly. A Sainsbury’s spokesman said: ‘We expect our suppliers to adhere to the highest quality and welfare standards, regardless of where they operate in the world. We are taking these allegations very seriously and will be conducting our own investigation.’ A Waitrose spokesman said: ‘Worker welfare is very important to us – our supplier is investigating these allegations and will ensure that our high standards are being met.’ A spokesman for the British Retail Consortium which represents all the supermarkets said: ‘Ensuring workers are treated fairly in our supply chains is a key concern for retailers. We know all supermarkets will examine these allegations closely.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Vegetables sold in UK are grown by workers 'denied basic hygiene facilities' in Almeria, Spain .

6660,e8b93366b9c9c5bf4409dc1f8064122063ccd4ca,"After two months and more than 100 witnesses, the prosecution has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez. The 25-year-old has pleaded not guilty to shooting  Odin Lloyd five times in the chest and back. Lloyd, who was dating his fiancee's sister, was found dead in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home on June 17, 2013. Prosecutors have presented hundreds of pieces of evidence since testimony began on January 29, including surveillance videos from inside Hernandez's home that showed him holding a black object that appeared to be a gun less than 10 minutes after Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . Trial: The jury has rested in the murder trial of former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez after two months and more than 100 witnesses that featured in the prosecution's case against him . William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, points to a mannequin while testifying about the location of bullet wounds in the body of Odin Lloyd  during the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end . A joint found near Lloyd's body had DNA from both men on it. And the shell of a bullet matching the one that killed Lloyd was found on the floor of Hernandez's car - stuck to a piece of gum that matched the former Patriot tight end's DNA. On the final day of testimony, the prosecution heard from William Zane, of the state medical examiner's office, who used a mannequin to point to where Odin Lloyd was allegedly shot - in the chest and in the back. The defense team, in contrast, is not expected to take long hitting back. Jurors could be sent to deliberate as early as next week. At the time of the alleged murder, Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots. Hernandez's legal team has contested the legitimacy of the evidence, calling into question the testimony of an employee of weapons manufacturer Glock who had identified the black object as a gun and arguing instead that it was a piece of electronics such as an iPad or a TV remote. They also have gone after the police investigation, painting it as bumbling and inept and saying Hernandez was targeted as a suspect because he is a celebrity. Decision: The defense team is expected to wrap up quickly next week before the jury delivers a verdict . Prosecutor William McCauley announced on Thursday that the prosecution had rested. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh then sent the jurors home. Garsh is expected to hear arguments Friday on several pending issues. Hernandez's lawyer James Sultan told Garsh this week that the defense team expects to call witnesses Monday and be completed with their questioning that day. Once the defense rests, each side will deliver a closing argument. Then the jury will be given instructions, and three alternates will be randomly selected from among the 15 jurors immediately before deliberating. A final jury of 12 members will decide Hernandez's fate. Eighteen jurors began the trial in January, but three were dismissed, including one who is accused of misrepresenting her answers during screening in a bid to get onto the jury.","Prosecutors have called more than 100 witnesses to testify .

487,4b1f1502773e8456675705204e5bc6e444fd1fae,"Accused: Officer Aaron Stringer, from Bakersfield, California, allegedly pulled on the toes and 'tickled' the feet of a man whom police had recently killed . A police officer who allegedly 'loves playing with dead bodies' has been accused of 'tickling' the feet and yanking on the head and toes of a dead man who had been recently shot killed by cops. Aaron Stringer, of the Bakersfield, California, Police Department, reportedly said 'tickle tickle' as he ran his fingers along the soles of the feet of Ramiro James Villegas, a 22-year-old whom officers killed the same day. A trainee police officer who was with him at the time told how Stringer then pulled on the corpse's toes, and pulled his head back and forth while discussing rigor mortis after the shooting on November 13. According to the Bakersfield Californian, he then said that he 'loves playing with dead bodies' and later told her to lie about what she'd seen. Stringer has been on paid administrative leave from the department since it started investigating the chilling accusations in November. Villegas was shot dead by police after crashing his car in a high-speed chase, ABC23 reported. Officers say they gunned him down after he got out of the car and reached for his waistband, raising fears that he had a gun. It later became clear that he wasn't armed. Stringer, who filed a police report about the day's activities, mentioned interviewing witnesses alongside trainee Lindy DeGeare, who eventually blew the whistle on the alleged corpse manipulation. Shot dead: Ramiro James Villegas, 22, had been shot dead on November 13 by Bakersfield Police after a car chase. Stringer allegedly 'played' with his body as it lay under a bloodied sheet . Let in: Stringer was allowed to see the body by a nurse at the Kern Medical Center, above . She said Stringer volunteered them to head to the Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield to help identify the body. It was there that a nurse gave them the passcode to the morgue where Villegas was being held. She said that when Stringer suggested she take a look at the body, she presumed it was part of legitimate training. Under California law, police officers are allowed to look at dead bodies to assess wounds, but are not supposed to handle them. According to the Bakersfield California, local prosecutors considered charging Stringer but dropped the case due to insufficient evidence. He is currently being investigated internally by the police department. A lawyer for the Villegas family said they are also 'very close' to filing a suit of their own.

Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.","Willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes .

Maria Malone-Guerbaa, 41, from London, used nothing but paints to turn herself into an uncanny painting of a grey rabbit with blue eyes, wearing a red bow tie. The mother-of-two said she didn't use any prosthetics or special effects to achieve the amazing result. Scroll down for video . Make-up artist Maria Malone-Guerbaa (left) just used paints to transform herself into a bunny . The final result took three hours to achieve after Maria simply googled pictures of bunnies, picking one she liked best and replicating the image on her face. She used her own brushes and kryolan paint, special dense, long-lasting make-up used by professionals working with stage actors. Maria began her project by painting a white base layer to create the shape of the rabbit's face and ears, adding the animal's eyes (below her own) and nose and mouth (over her own). The sides of her face and forehead was then painted with black paint, to form the bunny's entire head. With grey paint, black dots stippled over the top and finally details like whiskers, and the bow tie that is drawn from Maria's neck up to her chin, the look was complete. Maria explained her inspiration for her rabbit scheme: 'My last couple of projects have been animal-themed so, with Easter coming up, it had to be a rabbit this time around. 'It takes me about three hours in total and I'll stop every 20 minutes or so to take a picture of my progress. 'I just went on my iPhone and searched for rabbits on Google Images. You get so many then that you can just form your own picture.' The final result has earned thousands of likes on Instagram, along with her other posts showing how she transformed her face into Jack Nicholson from The Shining, Stevie Wonder, a cougar and Freddie Mercury. Maria used only her brushes and professional kryolan paints to create bunny ears, bright eyes and a nose . She captioned the picture: 'I've got #hare in my face!' She said: 'It's amazing to see other people enjoying my work. I can't quite put into words how flattering it is and it makes the whole thing worthwhile. 'One lady even got in touch who'd been inspired to try it out herself. That was the pinnacle for me: it was so humbling to think that my work had inspired someone else to do the same thing.' Originally from Limerick, Maria says she's always had a passion for art but only began doing celebrity lookalikes after she started face painting for parties for her children Sophia, 14, and Adam, 11.

3944,46989538fdcf535681ed8afbf3c60dc71565b39a,"The former NFL kicker Lawrence Tynes  is suing the Tampa Bay Buccaneers accusing them of unsanitary conditions that led to a MRSA infection  that he says ended his career. The 36-year-old is seeking $20million in lost future earnings and $15,000 in damages after he contracted the deadly infection in 2013 following a surgery on an ingrown toenail, according to  Albert Breer of the NFL Network. The lawsuit was announced on Monday and alleges that the Buccaneers 'failed to disclose and actively concealed ongoing incidents of the infection among other individuals' who used  team's facilities, according to ESPN. Lawrence Tynes has filed a lawsuit against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for $20million in lost future earnings . Tynes was in training camp with the Buccaneers in 2013 when he contracted the deadly MRSA infection . The suit also claims that the team did not use necessary sterile techniques and routinely left therapy devices, equipment and surfaces unclean, according to ESPN. Tynes and another player, offensive guard Carl Nicks, both contracted Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections during a July 2013 outbreak of the  infection during the Buccaneers' summer training camp prior to the season. Nicks reached a settlement with the team last year over his infection for $3million, according to Deadspin. Tynes, who has not kicked a football since 2012, said that he spent eight or nine days without being diagnosed and his infection worsened. 'No one cultured my toe at the facility,' he told ESPN. 'I left that facility on my own and found a doctor in town and said, 'Can you look at my toe because I think all the doctors at the Bucs are lying to me.' The former kicker is seeking an additional $15,000 in damages and says the infection has ended his career . The lawsuit claims that the team did not use necessary sterile techniques and routinely left therapy devices, equipment and surfaces unclean . 'And I took my sock off, he looks at my toe, without any scientific study or anything, he said, 'You have MRSA.' And I'm at a billion-dollar company with the supposed best doctors in the world, and not one of them told me that I had that? I know they knew I had it. They just didn't want me to have it.' He also told ESPN he nearly had his toe amputated due to MRSA, and said that because of the pain in his toe he can longer play. After he contracted the infection, Tynes was  placed on the non-football injury list (NFI) by the team just before the season began. MRSA is usually contracted by people in hospitals or other medical facilities. It is resistant to most antibiotic treatments and can lead to deadly flesh-eating bacteria. The infection can remain in the body for years while being treated. The superbug killed more people than AIDS in 2011. Source: Centers for Disease Control . The NFI list is the team's way of denying . liability after he contracted the precursor for flesh-eating bacteria, . which denies him of certain benefits he is eligible for while on IR. Players on IR reserve their full salary, an accrued season (towards both free agency and retirement benefits) and full health insurance – players on NFI receive none of those benefits. First infected after a July 30 procedure to remove an ingrown toenail on his kicking foot, in earlier reports Tynes said he went to the team after his foot became red and swollen within a few days. Six different antibiotics and three surgical procedures later, he previously told Fox Sports that the team was denying liability. 'I'm standing up for what I think is right,' Tynes told ESPN. 'Or what I know is right. I'm in this thing 'til the very end. I'm not going away.' The former New York Giants postseason hero had a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line hooked directly to his veins to more efficiently get antibiotics into his system to fight the infection, according to Fox Sports. The kicker's plight was first brought to the nation's attention by his wife after Buccaneers coach Greg Schiano told media the infected players were 'responding well' to treatment. 'I hear my husband is responding 'well' to treatment. LOL! He's NOT responding at all yet. This is our #bucslife,' Amanda Tynes tweeted August 13, 2013 with a picture of her ailing husband on the couch, hooked up to an intravenous drip. Less than a month later, with their kicker still sidelined and hopes of him recovering in time to contribute to the 2013 season dwindling, the Buccaneers informed the two-time Super Bowl champion the weekend before the season opener that he would be placed on the non-football injury list, further infuriating him and his wife. Tynes (9) twice kicked the New York Giants to the Super Bowl with NFC Championship-winning overtime field goals . 'The Bucs informed my husband via EMAIL that he will be placed on NFI. Wouldn't expect anything more from such a classy organization,' Amanda Tynes tweeted at the time. 'Historically, other teams have done the right thing,' said Lawrence Tynes. 'Other players who have had staph or MRSA, the appropriate designation is IR.' MRSA infections are resistant to most bacteria and, if untreated, can turn deadly. They are usually diagnosed in people who have been in hospitals or had medical procedures and can take years to overcome, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Tynes took to the airwaves to voice his concerns and speak out against what he felt was negligent treatment by the team. He signed a one-year contract with the Buccaneers prior to the 2013 season after a six-year stint with the Giants, where he became famous for twice nailing field goals in overtime that sent his team to the Super Bowl. Tynes started his career with the Kansas City Chiefs.","Lawrence Tynes contracted the deadly infection after surgery on his foot in 2013 and is now seeking an additional $15,000 in damages .

But they were snatched when the couple weren’t looking – and neighbours believe they have caught the culprit on CCTV. Caught on camera: This is the suspected dog-napper seen on CCTV footage with what appears to be two animals under his arms . ‘We just want them back,’ said Mrs Worgan, 49. ‘It’s devastating. None of us have been able to sleep or eat since.’ Mr Worgan was inside the house in Doncaster at around midday when he heard a yelp from the garden. He rushed outside in time to see a man get into a van with Marley and Mitzy and drive off.

3251,02e7ee52406518338ea1d184af26d107a3c0ab7c,"A shocking new video appearing to show at least 30 Christians being beheaded and shot by ISIS in Libya has been released. The 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', shows dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive, thought to be in the south and the west of the country. At least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', are lined up and shot in a desert area while 12 others are filmed being forced to walk down a beach before being beheaded. This follows another video in February of the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on the beach in Libya, though that terrain was rockier than the one shown in the latest film. It raises fears that ISIS is consolidating its presence on the 'doorstep of Europe', as Libya is just a few hundred miles from the coast of Italy. Scroll down for video . Thirty Ethiopian Christians appear to have been beheaded and shot by ISIS in a sickening new propaganda video. Above, at least 16 men are marched down a beach in Libya by militants before they are killed . Ethiopia was unable to confirm its citizens were killed in the footage but condemned the 'atrocious act', a government official said. The video shows the men at the coast wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits and being held at the neck by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces. The victims inland are forced to kneel as militants dressed in combats and green masks stand behind them holding rifles. It starts with what it called a 'history of Christian-Muslim relations', which includes scenes of militants destroying churches, graves and icons. A masked fighter in black then brandishes a pistol as he vows to kill Christians if they do not convert. In an apparent reference to Ethiopia's attacks on neighbouring Somalia, whose population is almost entirely Muslim, he says: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again.' The footage, which was released on websites and social media accounts officially linked to ISIS, also cuts to Christians in Syria explaining how they were given the choice of converting to Islam or paying a 'special tax'. At the end it switches between the two sets of captives - thought to be mainly migrant workers - with one group shot dead at point-blank range and the others beheaded on the beach. The video has not yet been verified. The men - wearing Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuits - are held at the neck and forced to kneel by fighters in combats with balaclavas covering their faces . The men, thought to be migrant works, are described by Islamic State in the video as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church' The footage also shows around 12 men being shot in a desert area, believed to be in the south of the country, by militants wearing green balaclavas and combats . A masked fighter in black (right) brandishing a pistol vows to kill Christians if they do not convert, saying: 'Muslim blood shed under the hands of your religions is not cheap. To the nation of the cross we are now back again' The victims are forced to kneel in front of the militants (above) before being shot at point-blank range simultaneously. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group . The militant in black - who is completely covered apart from his eyes - remains flanked by two people holding guns throughout the clip . Ethiopia is a predominantly Christian country with the religion being introduced in the country the 4th century, making it one of the oldest Christian states in the world. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is one of the oldest organized Christian bodies in the world, and more than 40 per cent of the population are members of the church. Around 20 per cent of the population follow other branches of Christianity, a majority being Protestant. Islam was not introduced in the country for another 300 years, and now about one third of Ethiopians identify as Muslim. Initial reports did not make clear who the captives were or when they were captured. The video bore the official logo of the IS media arm Al-Furqan and resembled previous footage released by the extremist group. Redwan Hussein, an Ethiopian government spokesman, said officials were in contact with its embassy in Cairo to verify the video's authenticity. He said he believed those killed were likely to have been Ethiopian migrants hoping to reach Europe. Libya has become a hub for migrants across Africa hoping to cross the Mediterranean to enter Europe for work and better lives. 'If this is confirmed, it will be a warning to people who wish to risk and travel to Europe though the dangerous route,' Mr Hussein said. He added that Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Libya, would help repatriate Ethiopians if they wanted to leave. Libyan officials were not immediately available for comment. Abba Kaletsidk Mulugeta, an official with the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church's Patriarchate Office, said he also believed the victims  were likely to have been migrants. 'I believe this is just another case of the IS group killing Christians in the name of Islam. Our fellow citizens have just been killed on a faith-based violence that is totally unacceptable. This is outrageous,' he said. 'No religion orders the killing of other people, even people from another religion.' Ethiopia's options to retaliate remain slim, given its distance from Libya. However, Ethiopian Ambassador to Egypt Mohammed Edrees said his country could partner with Cairo to strike the militants. 'That could be an option,' Mr Edrees said. 'We will see and explore what is possible to deal with group.' It comes just two months after the extremist group in Libya beheaded 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a beach (above) The latest video mirrored a film released in February showing militants beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a Libyan beach (pictured above), which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya . Frederic Wehrey, a senior associate for the Middle East Programme at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said: 'The Islamic State in Libya is still focused on this consolidation phase of announcing its presence through these very high-profile executions. But they face some structural limits in terms of how much local support they can get because they haven't captured real revenue streams.' It comes just two months after IS militants  filmed themselves beheading 21 captured Egyptian Christians on a similar beach, which immediately drew Egyptian airstrikes on the group's suspected positions in Libya. ISIS has been able to gain a foothold amid chaos in Libya, where two governments backed by rival alliances of militias are battling each other as well as extremist groups. The group is also advancing in Iraq, where it has captured three villages near the city of Ramadi. Islamic State fighters, pictured carrying flags and dressed in black, have been able to gain a foothold amid the chaos in Libya . More than 90,000 people have fled the ISIS's advance in Anbar, a United Nations humanitarian agency said earlier this morning. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a statement that civilians are fleeing Ramadi as well as the three nearby villages captured by the IS group a few days ago. Lise Grande, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, said: 'Our top priority is delivering life-saving assistance to people who are fleeing - food, water and shelter are highest on the list of priorities.' Iraqi officials in Anbar have described Ramadi as a ghost town, with empty streets and closed shops. Iraqi troops backed by Shiite militias and U.S.-led airstrikes managed to dislodge ISIS, which controls large parts of Iraq and Syria and wants to redraw the map of the Middle East, from the northern city of Tikrit earlier this month. But the troops have struggled against the militants in Anbar, which saw some of the heaviest fighting of the eight-year U.S. military intervention that ended in 2011. Elsewhere today, the US-led coalition said Kurdish forces recaptured 11 villages in Iraq's Kirkuk province from ISIS following days of intense clashes. The coalition said the area of about 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) was south of the city of Kirkuk.","Video seems to show militants in Libya holding one group of at least 16 captive on a beach and 12 others in a desert .

The French midfielder had just put in a dominant display at the Emirates Stadium as the Ligue 1 side all-but-sealed their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League after a 3-1 first-leg win. But rather than Arsenal, it now seems Liverpool hold the main Premier League interest in the 22-year-old. So, what more do you need to know? Monaco midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia is a Liverpool target and has also interested Arsenal in recent years . 22? He's been around for a while... Despite his young age, Kondogbia has amassed over 100 league appearances for Lens, Monaco, and even Sevilla. And during that five-year professional career, the central midfielder has been constantly watched by Arsenal scouts. He also impressed at the FIFA Under-20 World Cup alongside Paul Pogba in the French midfield, while his frame and playing style doesn't exactly scream 22 years old. Kondogbia is only 22 but has racked up over 100 league appearances with Lens (above), Sevilla and Monaco . The central midfielder was a key player for France alongside Paul Pogba at the Under 20 World Cup in 2013 . Tough guy then? Exactly. Standing at 6'2"", Kondogbia is a real presence in the Monaco midfield, allowing the likes of Joao Moutinho to strut their stuff further forward. He's strong in the tackle, but make no mistake, his prowess on the ball is also impressive. Possessing a fine left foot, Kondogbia doubles up as a playmaker, and also scored the first goal in the tie in the first leg against Arsenal. Having made his mark in both Ligue 1 and La Liga, you could say the Frenchman is the perfectly well-rounded midfielder, someone who would fit in seamlessly in the Premier League... Kondogbia's fine strike put Monaco in front against Arsenal in the Champions League last-16 first leg . So why haven't we seen him in England? Time is still on Kondogbia's side, but Premier League clubs have certainly tried. Arsenal were heavily linked with him before he left Sevilla, though the versatile player bought out his contract and opted for Monaco. With Liverpool crying out for players to freshen up an ageing/departing spine, the 22-year-old's presence would surely suit Brendan Rodgers. But he must move quick, with Real Madrid, Manchester United, Juventus and Paris St Germain all keen to sign the man who has been capped three times by his national team.

There has been fresh talk this week of Real Madrid being interested in the goalkeeper, with it even being suggested in Spain that talks had opened between the club, Begovic's representatives and his current employers. But, at his press conference to preview Saturday's Barclays Premier League home clash with Southampton, Hughes said: 'There will be a lot of stories bandied about, but I would take that one with a pinch of salt to be perfectly honest. I don't think that is true.' Stoke keeper Asmir Begovic has been linked with a summer move to Spanish giants Real Madrid . The Bosnia international has been one of the Premier League's most consistent keepers . Potters boss Mark Hughes has played down reports of Begovic leaving the Brittania Stadium . Begovic is out of contract in 2016 and Hughes has repeatedly emphasised his optimism the 27-year-old Bosnia international will sign a new deal with Stoke this summer. 'We are scheduled to have talks with Asmir's people in the next few weeks I think,' the manager said on Friday. 'I think both parties have stated that probably at the end of the season those talks will come to a conclusion, and we are very hopeful Asmir will stay here. 'There will be speculation around better players at football clubs, and we are no different. He has attracted attention because he is an outstanding goalkeeper.' In terms of other potential items of summer business, Hughes is also hopeful Stoke will wrap up the signing of teenage winger Moha El Ouriachi from Barcelona. It was reported earlier this week that the 19-year-old Moroccan-born player was bound for the Potters this summer after deciding joining them was a better option than accepting the new contract offer made to him by Barca. And Hughes said on Friday: 'There is a hope that we will be able to conclude that deal.' Barcelona B winger Moha El Ouriachi is set to sign for Stoke City, according to the player's agent . Stoke have already signed Bojan Krkic and Marc Muniesa from Barcelona in the last two years . The Welshman, who is a former Barcelona striker and who has previously signed forward Bojan Krkic and defender Marc Muniesa for Stoke from the Catalan outfit, added: 'We are trying to improve the quality of the Under-21 group and he (El Ouriachi) is a good young player. 'He is one we think we can bring to the club, so we will try to pursue that one and it looks very hopeful. 'He is predominantly left-footed, has good ability one on one and has good pace. He ticks a lot of the boxes in terms of what we are looking for in young players. 'If we can get it concluded, once he is here then we hope to develop him and push him towards the first team if we can. 'He is not one that is going to go straight into my team, but it is with a view that in the future it will happen.' Stoke will be without Muniesa and winger Victor Moses for Saturday's contest. Stoke will be without winger Victor Moses after the Chelsea loanee picked up a hamstring injury . Muniesa misses out due to a slight hamstring strain, while on-loan Moses has returned to parent club Chelsea because of a hamstring problem of his own that is expected to keep him sidelined for the rest of the season. Defenders Marc Wilson and Erik Pieters are both nursing knocks to the wrist but Hughes feels the pair should be available for the visit of the Saints. Meanwhile, Potters forward Peter Odemwingie returned to full training on Thursday as his recovery from the knee injury that has kept him sidelined since August goes on, with a return to first-team action before the end of the campaign his target. As a club, 10th-placed Stoke are continuing to work towards the goal of bettering their record Premier League haul of 50 points achieved last season when Hughes guided them to their best finish in the division of ninth. Nigerian forward Peter Odenwingie has returned to training after a lengthy spell on the sidelines . They currently have 43 points and the game against sixth-placed Southampton is the first of six more games they have left to play this term. Hughes' men have not won in their last four matches but picked up their first point in that sequence last time out with a 1-1 draw at West Ham, and he is adamant the campaign is not petering out. 'We have our own things we want to chase and achieve this year,' Hughes said. 'They are still very much there for us, so the challenge is to keep our focus. 'I was really pleased with the performance at West Ham. If we were a team looking ahead to the summer break, we wouldn't have been able to score as late as we did (stoppage time).'","Mark Hughes has played down reports linking keeper with Real Madrid .

3352,a23bdac917f9f65647c2b42a4e625b5070d23624,"Labour were left embarrassed tonight after it was forced to remove a signatory to a letter of support after she was exposed as a benefit cheat who had swindled nearly £30,000. Campaign chiefs attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’. The signatories, who said they were ‘all working people’, warned about the ‘proliferation of zero-hours contracts’ they claimed were ‘letting down Britain’ and showed that ‘we need a Labour Government to put working people first’. Labour attempted to rebuff a letter from 100 business leaders that criticised the party by publishing its own message calling for a Labour government signed by people ‘from all walks of life’ But within hours the plan was in chaos as it was found the signatories included a benefit fraudster, trade unionists and the cigar-smoking children of millionaires. One of the signatories identified herself as someone who had ‘worked on [a] zero hours contract’, but Labour removed her name yesterday after it was revealed she had been convicted of benefit fraud in 2012. A court in Manchester heard that the woman moved to Britain after she had a ‘marriage of convenience’ in Nigeria in December 2007. According to tax officials she lived with her ‘husband’, who was the holder of a British passport, ‘briefly or not at all’. She was not entitled to benefits as she was subject to ‘immigration control’, but she submitted a tax credits application and a child benefit claim for three children, two of whom didn’t live with her. The court heard that she moved in with a new partner but claimed £27,888 tax credits in two and a half years as a single person. David Cameron, visiting pupils during his visit to King's Leadership Academy in Warrington today, hailed the business letter in support of the Tories . She was caught after she applied for leave to remain in Britain on the basis of her ‘marriage’. Officers found that she had been fraudulently claiming benefits and had allowed others to use her name and national insurance number to work illegally in the UK. In July 2012 she was given a two year suspended jail sentence and a 150-hour community work order after she pleaded guilty to immigration and fraud charges along with her ‘husband’ who had been working at HMRC as a security officer. A Labour spokesman last night said: ‘More than 6,000 people have now signed our letter from all walks of life across the country. Former Red or Dead boss Wayne Hemingway was among the signatories . ‘Of course we were unaware of the background of this person. The fact still remains that the epidemic of zero hours contracts are a symbol of the failure of this Government's economic plan.’ Other signatories included 21-year-old Manchester University students John-Jo Pierce and Rory Somerville. The pair said they were both working on zero hours contracts but their Facebook pages included photographs of them smoking cigars whilst dressed in black tie. Mr Pierce, who is studying maths, is registered on the electoral roll at his parents’ £1million house in woodland near Leatherhead, Surrey. His mother Deirdre, 55, yesterday said that he was ‘just a kid’ who ‘knows nothing about politics’ but had signed the letter after he was asked to by a fellow university student ‘he vaguely knows’. She told the Mail: ‘All he did was sign a petition that somebody called Andrea asked everybody to sign. He knows a little but not much. It’s the first time he’s been interested in an election.’ She declined to discuss what work he was doing on a zero hours contract. Mr Somerville, who is in his final year studying economics, is register to vote at his mother's house in an affluent area of Belfast. Mr Pierce was also photographed at a party in front of a sign that said ‘Drugz Room’, but Mrs Pierce said that it was just a ‘joke’ sign that was a reference to the U.S. television programme Breaking Bad. She said: ‘John-Jo has never done drugs in his life. It’s a joke about Breaking Bad. That’s what people of that age do. They all make jokes about Breaking Bad.’ Mr Somerville did not respond to a request to comment.","Signatory to letter backing Labour was given suspended sentence .

9116,d5d1809a32a3efb8b52e4c60faed8791617a7d16,"Battleground: Esther McVey, who won her Wirral West seat in 2010 with a majority of just 2,436, has demanded that Ed Miliband condemns the attacks . Tory minister Esther McVey has called on Ed Miliband to condemn the ‘scurrilous’ campaign against her after she was branded ‘murderer McVey’ in graffiti. The employment minister also had an election song written about her by  rivals claiming she was going to hell. Miss McVey has been one of the party’s most prominent rising stars, but is the Tory Cabinet minister most at risk of becoming a casualty on election night with a fierce battle to cling on to her marginal Wirral West seat. Yesterday the former GMTV presenter, who won in 2010 with a majority of just 2,436, insisted that she would not be cowered by the ‘misogynistic and sexist’ attacks that she said showed what the Labour party really thinks of women. ‘If they think by coming in the dead of the night and scribbling on a wall and by being anonymous on Twitter that they will intimidate and bully me they are picking on the wrong person,’ she said. ‘I believe it is right that we have a Conservative MP up here who is sitting at the table at Cabinet, so their underhand tactics won’t bully and intimidate me.’ Miss McVey, who was given a job in the Cabinet by David Cameron last July, said that she is one of a number of women sat around the table who knows how to have her voice heard and shows the party is not solely made up of women in ‘twin-sets and pearls’. She also revealed how the network of female Tory ministers, including Home Secretary Theresa May, support each other with text messages, phone calls and by taking each other out for drinks. Miss McVey, who is the only Conservative MP on Merseyside, said her political opponents are trying to create ‘an atmosphere of fear’ in her seat. Local trade union activists launched their ‘Sack Esther McVey’ campaign last year on her birthday and a song with the same name has been recorded and posted on the internet. The vile lyrics claim that Miss McVey ‘torments the sick and poor’, ‘is going to hell’ and that ‘the wicked witch of the Wirral’s had her day’. Last year Labour MP John McDonnell joked that her constituents want to ‘lynch the b*****d’ and last week John Prescott accused her of being ‘heartless’. At a Labour rally in her constituency, the former Labour deputy prime minister claimed to forget her name and said he only remembered her because of the dress she wore into Downing Street when she was promoted. The job centre in Hoylake, at the centre of her constituency, was also targeted with graffiti at the end of last month that read: ‘McVey murderer.’ Miss McVey said: ‘Of course it’s hurtful, not just to me, but more so sometimes for your family and friends. ‘I have to say, John Prescott has never been good with words. He doesn’t know my name and he has shown he knows a big fat zero about me as well. ‘I am totally driven by my heart and my head. You cannot give away what you have not got, but you have got to have the right motives. I wouldn’t believe in social mobility if I didn’t have a heart.’ Message: Graffiti on Wirral job centre accusing MP Esther McVey of being a murderer in one of a number of attacks . Defiant: The former GMTV presenter, pictured yesterday with Northern Ireland secretary Theresa Villiers, right, and her campaign team spoke out about being targeted in offensive graffiti and songs . Miss McVey said that despite the personal attacks she is not afraid to go out canvassing by herself. She said: ‘Oh yeah of course I do. I live here. I walk down here. I go canvassing by myself all the time. ‘They’re trying to paint a very ugly picture and trying to create an atmosphere of fear, but that is not the case. The people of Wirral West are not like that.’ She added: ‘The attacks have been misogynistic and sexist and I find it rather mystifying how the Labour party purports to be a party for a woman and yet have run this scurrilous campaign against me and at no time has it been condemned by Ed Miliband. ‘I think this myth that they’re for women is only a myth and the reality is the campaign they have run against me shows what they truly think about women.’ Miss McVey, who was one of only five ministers to make it onto the front page of the Conservative manifesto alongside Mr Cameron, hit back at suggestions she was only there as a ‘token woman’. She said: ‘I believe I was there because as minister for employment we have seen a record number of jobs created in the economy, two million jobs.’ After earlier this year revealing her ambition to one day become prime minister, Miss McVey said she hopes that another woman will become Tory leader in her lifetime. She said: ‘Every time requires a different leader and hopefully in our lifetimes there will be time when another woman is needed as leader.’ As she hosted a women business leaders event in her constituency yesterday alongside Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Lords Leader Baroness Stowell, Miss McVey talked about the support she has received from other women in the Cabinet behind the scenes. She also denied that the Tory party is predominantly made up of women in twin-sets and pearls. ‘No. For me I have never have thought that because the Tory women I knew were not like that,’ she said. ‘The Tory women in this room are just people running a business, looking after a family, there is not anybody here in twin-set and pearls, they are just regular people who understand you cannot spend what you have not got.’ Support: Miss McVey was flanked by Ms Villiers and and felow Tory Grant Shapps on the campaign trail yesterday . Asked if it was easy being only one of only a few women in Cabinet, she said: ‘You have got to look at it from both sides of the table, we might be in lesser numbers but sometimes that can make you more visible and your points more pertinent too. ‘I’m the sort of person who doesn’t look at what could be the difficulties and “oh say I give up”. Look at the difficulties, rise to the challenge and make sure your voice is being heard.’ Miss McVey said that the female Tory ministers exchange text messages, phone calls and go out for drinks together. She said: ‘Of course you are busy doing what you do but there is a support behind the scenes. ‘People like Justine Greening will say “let’s go out for a drink”. ‘Theresa May was chairman of the party when I came in. She was very good at giving the realities of the job, what were the expectations, what support can you have, is there anything else you need to know. ‘Obviously there are phone calls that you have with one another – “how do you deal with that?”, “what do you do?”, “what would your advice be on this?”. ‘There’s personal support and professional support and Theresa May has given both.’ Miss McVey said that she was pleased to see Nicola Sturgeon, Natalie Bennett and Leanne Wood representing their parties in the televised leaders debates even though she disagrees with them politically. She said: ‘Obviously their policies aside, for women to get to the top of their profession, that’s what I have fought for all of my life, I think that’s fantastic.’ Tory chairman Grant Shapps, who also visited Miss McVey’s seat yesterday, condemned the campaign against her. He said: ‘I think it’s completely unacceptable and it has to stop. I call on the Labour leadership locally and nationally to reign it in because it is not the sort of civilised debate we should be having.’ Last year the Labour Party said Mr McDonell’s comment did ‘not represent the views of the Labour Party’, but refused to withdraw the whip from him. The local Labour Party has condemned the ‘murder McVey’ graffiti and said it was the council leader who reported the vandalism and ordered its immediate removal.","Esther McVey will not be cowered by 'misogynistic and sexist' attacks .

But not for three women who are not only scoring red carpet gigs and A-list actors but are now being dubbed 'power stylists' in Hollywood Reporter's 'Power Stylist for 2015' hit list, thanks to their A-list Aussie starlets. Scoring sixth place on the list is Elizabeth Stewart, a former fashion editor for Women’s Wear Daily and the New York Times and whose credited with styling Australian actress Cate Blanchett as well as mega stars including Sandra Bullock, Julia Roberts and Amanda Seyfried.

Popular Australian comedian Rebel Wilson also recently enlisted Stewart's style advice in a bid to bring a sense of 'classiness' to her image in Tinseltown. Stewart was also voted number one stylist on The Hollywood Reporter's Power Stylist list last year, and was also blamed for causing a major fashion stir for having Blanchett (dubbed ‘the darling of Hollywood’) be the first to step out in a black frayed dress for Maison Margiela by John Galliano (after the disgraced designer left Valentino) during her Blue Jasmine acclaim. Also notably scoring eighth place was Cristina Elrich, the stylist responsible for creating a fresh faced glamour look for Aussie beauty Margot Robbie (during both her blonde and brunette red carpet appearances) and an Amazonian style for mystical Australian actress Isabel Lucas. Style sisters: Jeanann Williams, Naomi Watts' longtime stylist, placed ninth on the list . Personal and professional: Jeannan also used to date Naomi's brother Ben, and the pair share a daughter . Elrich’s other accolades include styling stars such as Penelope Cruz, Jessica Biel and Girls star Allison Williams. Straight after Elrich is Naomi Watts's stylist Jeann Williams, making the hit list at number nine. Williams manages to keep the ‘Diana’ star on the watch list every event (and is also well versed in maintain Watt’s partner Liev Shreiber’s dapper look beside her on the red carpet). Williams has had a strong advantage with her A-list clientele, when Watt’s, one of her most famous, is also the Aunt to her daughter (Williams used to date Watt’s brother acclaimed photographer Ben Watts).

5130,c868e5977a60be4bb8f74611c058bcb9109137e2,"A mother-of-three repeatedly knifed in the head by her violent boyfriend has revealed how she begged him to put her to bed so she didn't die on the floor. Joanne Bolton told how she thought she was going to die at the hands of Steven Young during the 'brutal and merciless' seven hour long ordeal. The 35-year-old was stabbed over 14 times before being knocked out with a mental bar after being held captive in her own home. Joanne Bolton, pictured in hospital,  did not believe she was going to survive the horrific attack that saw her knifed more than 14 times . Such was the force of the attack, that the blade of a knife being used to stab her in the head broke. But this did not end the nightmare, instead Young chose a bigger weapon and continued his violent onslaught. 'I didn't think I was going to survive and I asked him to put me to bed because I didn't want to die on the floor,' said Miss Bolton of New Kyo, Stanley, County Durham. 'I felt euphoric, I stopped feeling the cold and had no strength left. I knew I didn't have long left.' Miss Bolton was already fleeing from a violent relationship when she met Young and jumped at the chance to move in with him after staying in a refuge. But soon after he became possessive and violent and started using her a punchbag as he fought his own insecurities. Steven Young, pictured right,  was jailed for 18 years by a judge at Newcastle Crown Court after he admitted attempted murder of Miss Bolton, pictured left, shortly after the seven hour ordeal . Miss Bolton, a former support worker, says he was using drugs and was on prescribed methadone which led to paranoia at times. But in May he exploded after she had posted a photo and message on Facebook saying she was unhappy. 'He would wind himself up to breaking point. He would say I was cheating on him but it was him cheating on me,' she said. 'But on that day I had been outside fixing my car and had been talking to a young lad who collects scrap metal. 'He [Young] was upset because of the Facebook message. I went into the kitchen and opened a tin of tuna and he stuck a six inch knife in my head. 'The blade was sticking in my head and I thought 'oh my God, I'm going to die'. I couldn't pull it out but he did. 'He pulled it so hard it gave me whiplash and the blade snapped on the way out and fell on the floor. He went for another big knife and he stabbed me in the back and it punctured my kidney. 'He then stabbed me twice in the chest - once in the breast and once in the lung. My lung was filling with blood, I knew I was in trouble and I was coughing up blood. The mother-of-three  has been left scarred for life and needed more than 100 stitches to her face, arms and body . 'I didn't feel the stabs, it just felt like punches, I feel more pain in my dreams now. 'He kept telling me I was going to die and was trying to stab me in the eyes and kept lunging and stabbing me in the head and face, over and over and over again. I put my arm up to protect myself. 'He cut through the nerves, tendons, veins and ligaments above my wrist, blood spurted out. 'From my wrist it was hanging off. He then stabbed me in the thumb, I needed over 100 stitches in total.' Young pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was given an 18-year sentence in February at Newcastle Crown Court. Jailing him, Judge Paul Sloan told him: 'During the attack Miss Bolton truly believed she was going to die and she has suffered profound physical and mental suffering. 'This was a particularly brutal, merciless and sustained attack that must have been truly terrifying for the victim. 'There is a significant risk to members of the public, particularly partners and former partners, of serious harm by you.' Mum-of-three Joanne added: 'I was left in my own pool of blood and I was very cold. 'I was there for hours and then I crawled towards the fire to get warm. 'When I was on my hands and knees he took a power bar and played golf with my head. He hit me in the forehead which flung me backwards then hit me on the shoulder which fractured the bones in my shoulder blade.' Thinking of a way out, gasping for breath, Miss Bolton persuaded Young to put her on the bed and said she had £20 for him to uy drugs. Miss Bolton now suffers with mild brain damage and is often scared to leave the house . On his return she begged him to call an ambulance, saying she would blame her injuries on someone else. She was in intensive care on a ventilator and was in surgery for six hours. 'I had been sterilised when I was 22 because I had real problems during my three births but somehow was pregnant during this,' said Joanne. 'I miscarried after my shoulder operation but that plays heavy on my mind now. 'I never expected to be pregnant again, that was not supposed to happen, but I was and it survived those weeks while this was happening' The frenzied attack has left Joanne with mild brain damage, she struggles to detect smell, has short time memory problems and is often too scared to leave the house. But now new boyfriend Brett Ritchie, 40, of South Stanley, is helping her through her nightmare. 'Brett is different, he is patient, caring and would go to the end of the world and back for me. 'I genuinely feel I am with someone for the right reasons.' Dad-of-six Brett said: 'She has got a lot of trust to gain back and that takes time, but I'm willing to wait because I love her.'","Joanne Bolton was stabbed over 14 times before being battered with a bar .

3527,1aeeb44abc1ac14c4951c9e3842968441edd7526,"Marcelo Bosch basked in the gratitude of his team-mates after kicking Saracens into the semi-finals of the Champions Cup in dramatic scenes in north Paris. Bosch, striking the ball into a strong wind, landed a 55-metre penalty in the final act of the last eight showdown against Racing Metro to snatch a 12-11 victory at the Stade Yves-Du-Manoir. It completed a scarcely believable win given Saracens had been battered for most of the match only to display remarkable tenacity and set up a semi-final appointment with Clermont in St Etienne in two weeks. Marcelo Bosch kicks the winning penalty as Saracens beat Racing Metro 12-11 . Bosch is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring the kick that won his team the game . Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall admitted he was surprised to see Bosch taking the penalty . 'With kicks like this you're either the hero of the day or the bad guy, so I'm happy that it went my way. I just stayed relaxed and fortunately it went through the posts,' Bosch, 31, said. 'Sometimes they ask me if I'm keen to take the long-range kicks and because of the wind it was not a good distance for the other kickers. I said 'why not? I can take it' and the rest is history. 'The last time I did a kick like that was when I was 21 and playing for an amateur club in Argentina. It was from more or less the same range against our classico rivals. 'It was a great memory for me, but it was a long time ago. I tried to be as relaxed as possible because we had the wind in our face and I didn't want to force it. 'It was the last minute of the game so I was tired and tried not to think about what it represented.' Bosch also executed a try-saving tackle on Racing wing Juan Imhoff when all his Argentina team-mate had to do was fall over the line for a potentially decisive final-quarter try. 'Juan is a real player. He's like a striker - always smelling the goal. I followed him and fortunately stopped him from scoring at the end,' Bosch said. Until Bosch delivered the knockout blow - referee Nigel Owens awarded the penalty with 10 seconds left on the clock - a full blooded quarter-final that was often a poor spectacle appeared to be destined for a home win. Saracens fly-half Charlie Hodgson kicked one penalty and full-back Alex Goode supplied six points to keep the match favourites in sight. Two second-half penalties from scrum-half Maxime Machenaud, who also crossed for the game's solitary try in the 27th minute, placed Racing in control that the Parisians only relinquished as Owens was preparing to blow for full time. 'I was surprised to see it was Bosch taking it because I though it was in Alex Goode's range,' Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall said. 'But the wind was very strong, so it was Bosch's range. He had the nerve and balls to say he wanted it, which is half the battle. He hit it pretty sweetly. 'Marcelo is pretty cool. He's pretty laid back, but like anybody, that's one of those kicks that if you miss it can cause the damage. 'I'm very grateful that he held his nerve. He also made the tackle on our goalline that kept us in the match as well. Chris Ashton (left) of Saracens is tackled by Juan Imhoff of Racing Metro in the quarter-final clash . Alex Goode (centre) of Saracens sprints with the ball as Jamie Roberts (right) approaches . 'We weren't great in the first half even though we had a very strong wind behind us. But that's where it turned around and I'd say our second half performance was as courageous, brave and hard working as I've seen. 'We went hunting and kept knocking them down and scrapped for absolutely everything.' Racing's Wales centre Jamie Roberts was distraught at the outcome. 'I'm hugely frustrated and gutted for the team. We thought we had it in the bag. That last minute cost us so fair play to Marcelo with the kick at the end,' Roberts said.","Marcelo Bosch secured a  12-11 win for Saracens against Racing Metro .

The brolly-clad thieves targeted supermarkets, convenience stores and electrical shops, swiping £2,000 worth of cigarettes and cars valued at £30,000 in the process. CCTV footage from one of the raids in Tipton, West Midlands, shows the gang using umbrellas to conceal their entrance as they burst into a supermarket, where they stole cash from the offices. Scroll down for video . Umbrella thieves: A gang of armed robbers used pink brollies to confuse staff as they raided 13 shops in a two-month crime spree in the West Midlands . The gang  also threatened shop workers with hammers, knives and screwdrivers, before punching one employee in the face. In a separate raid, the men stole the store manager's Mercedes E200 which they used as their getaway car. The group have now been jailed for more than 27 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to rob. Police caught the thieves following a raid on an Asda supermarket in Coseley, West Midlands, where they were armed with hammers and what was reported to be a gun in a plastic bag.

During the searches, police found fluorescent jackets, identical to those used in the raids, along with banks statements showing large transfers of cash.

They also discovered numerous cash bags from a shop known as Farmfords, one of those targeted by the group, as well as £2,500 in cash. Mobile phones found at the addresses also showed several calls made between the group, while number plate analysis linked the defendants to the areas where the crimes had been committed. Liam Bell, 19, from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, and 22-year-old Trea Richardson, from Hansworth, were arrested in June last year, at the time of the warrants being executed. Marcus Morgan, 21, from Tividale, West Midlands, went on the run for five months before being detained in November. Guilty: Ashleigh Evans, 26 (left) from West Bromwich and Marcus Morgan, 21 (right) from Tividale, West Midlands, were jailed for ten years and seven years respectively for their parts in the 13 robberies . Jailed: Liam Bell, 19 (left), from Rowley Regis was jailed for six years and six months while Trea Richardson, 22 (right) from Hansowrth, was sentened to a four-year jail term . Ashleigh Evans, 26, from West Bromwich, was arrested on a flight back from Amsterdam. Officers even found the umbrella captured on CCTV in his luggage. On Friday, Evans was sentenced to 10 years in prison, while Bell was jailed for six years and six months. Richardson received a four-year jail term while Morgan was sentenced to seven years. Sentencing Morgan, Recorder William Mousley QC said to Morgan: 'No doubt you would have seen the fear in the eyes of the people you were robbing yet you carried on thereafter. 'It was not a one-off, it was a course of conduct you decided to engage in quite freely for a few weeks. 'This was professional, commercial robbery for significant financial gain where people were disguised and premises targeted that were vulnerable where people worked hard for not much money. 'They were not the type of premises where workers would expect people like you to come in and rob the store. The only mitigation I can find other than your guilty plea is your youth.' Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Rich Whitehouse, from West Midlands Police, said: 'The money and value of goods stolen, while significant, is nothing compared to the impact these offences have had on the staff members of the targeted premises. 'These offences were carefully planned and the group went to great lengths to conceal their involvement, often using umbrellas as cover when walking from the street to the shops, so as not to draw attention to their face coverings. 'However, the more offences they committed the more arrogant they became. There was also a clear escalation in the type of weapons used in the robberies and I am in no doubt they would have gone on to seriously hurt someone had they not been stopped.'","Thieves raided supermarkets and electrical shops during 55-day spree .

11382,1ecb11d97cc3290881a814fa863c1b06b6b96502,"(CNN)The new emojis are here! On Thursday, Apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won't cut it. The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate, a range of cheers and jeers. Why is any of this important, you may ask? For many, these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting. Rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or even hair color is part of mainstream America -- despite what others might say. This matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day. Think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling. Or more accurately, think of a white face smiling because up until Thursday's update, all the emojis had pale skin. But that has all changed. Now there's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from, including yellow, brown and black.  I'm sure few people will be upset with this development. But how about in December? Why? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include ... Santa Claus. That shrieking sound you may have heard was from Fox News' Megyn Kelly, who famously stated in 2013 that Santa Claus is absolutely, definitely and without a doubt a white guy.  In fact, thanks to Apple, we may even see Brown Santa emojis this December. (Could that mean he's a Muslim Santa?! Cue even more shrieking from Fox News.) There is more. Apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis, kissing with a heart over their heads. This inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on Twitter. It's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same-sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of ""religious liberty."" But it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates might have to say about ""gay emojis."" And I would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay. The fact is, when you embrace diversity, you will still leave out other minority groups. Redheads, for example, are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color. In fact, supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures. Even expanding the flags represented by emojis, as Apple has done, comes at some peril. Apparently Canada is overjoyed that finally Apple has included it. But Armenians are not happy they were left out. I must admit that being partially of Palestinian heritage, it's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a Palestinian state, Apple has chosen to now include a Palestinian flag emoji. Armenia, I feel your pain. Of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is: What took Apple so long? How hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from? That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this. Apple has ""evolved"" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples. Maybe ""religious liberty"" conservatives who discriminate will follow.","Dean Obeidallah: Apple's new emoji lineup is diverse in race, ethnicity and sexual orientation .
It's just like America, but what took Apple so long? Obeidallah asks .
He says change may rankle (or win over?) conservatives who discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation ."

It sums up the approach of many of their fanbase – they haven't fully bought into the idea that City could be one of the giants of Europe. Celebrity fan Ricky Hatton wants 'the old City back', while rock-God City lover Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the fans. Manuel Pellegrini could be worried about his position at Manchester City after losing against their fierce rivals . (Left to right) Segio Aguero, Yaya Toure and James Milner look dejected as they await kick-off after a goal . Boxer Ricky Hatton, pictured at the Etihad for a press conference in 2008, says he wants 'the old City back' Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the City supporters . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of their last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. One of the weirdest things I've been hearing lately is people saying Manuel Pellegrini was the right man at the right time for Manchester City. Their logic is that his calm was needed after the Roberto Mancini reign ended with a fractured dressing room, and an FA Cup final defeat at the hands of Wigan Athletic. Pellegrini is calm but it was the worst kind of short-term thinking which has led to City now clinging on to fourth place. The dressing room calmed down temporarily, but he doesn't have the character or gravitas to galvanise a group of players when the going gets tough. He's punching above his weight at Manchester City. City need to stop pussy-footing around and drag the fans into the modern game. They need to fill up the half-empty glasses of the supporters at the Etihad. Pellegrini's appointment would have suited those fans who resist the charge towards potential greatness. He is not a great manager. Look at his record before he arrived in England. He's done well but there is no evidence of greatness, and no suggestion of greatness to come. Frank Lampard applauds the travelling fans at Old Trafford as he leaves the pitch with goalkeeper Joe Hart . Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Pellegrini after the final whistle at Old Trafford . Jose Mourinho? Ronald Koeman? Sean Dyche? Not even close... Louis van Gaal should be crowned manager of the year . Forget Eden Hazard and Michael Carrick... the best player in the Premier League this weekend was Leicester's Jamie Vardy . And so it has proved. The signings Manchester City have made have also smacked of small-time thinking. They don't go for the great players anymore, they're not in that market. Jesus Navas is the perfect example: he is quick and that's it. He missed a great chance at the start of the Manchester derby because his end product is so poor. He cost a relatively cheap £15million, but at 29 years old (he was signed in 2013), you wonder what the logic was behind this purchase. He's not good enough to be a regular in the starting line-up at a club with ambitions of dominating the Champions League and Barclays Premier League. Why weren't City in the market for Cesc Fabregas? Or Diego Costa? How come they didn't sign Angel di Maria? Financial Fair Play is often used as the excuse – it's holding City back apparently. Look at United, look at Chelsea – be cleverer with the spreadsheets and FFP isn't a problem. Aguero and Jesus Navas prepare for a free-kick at Old Trafford as the latter struggles to inspire the side . Navas is not good enough to be a regular in the starting XI at a club with ambitions of dominating Europe . City opted against going in the market for players such as Cesc Fabregas (left) and Angel di Maria . City's failure to make any kind of serious progress in Europe reflects badly on English football, but the fault is with the club. They need to think bigger and drag themselves towards greatness. Make big signings, they will improve the team, and if they arrive, they will motivate the big players already at City. Yaya Toure strikes me as the kind of player who will raise his game significantly if he had Sami Khedira alongside him, rather than Fernando. The big message out of City this season has been how brilliant and shiny their new academy set-up is. And it is truly spectacular – a world-class facility. But they don't have the team to match it and they absolutely don't have the manager. If they choose to lose Pellegrini, then they need to think big next time and go for a manager showing true potential to be great – like Diego Simeone or Jurgen Klopp. Pellegrini has been accused of punching above his weight at Premier League champions City . Diego Simeone (left) or Jurgen Klopp could be potential replacements for the City manager . Carlo Ancelotti is another that fits the bill if he was to leave current club Real Madrid at the end of the season . Two managers at less fashionable clubs, trying to fight with the big boys in their domestic league and in Europe. Or go for greatness itself – Carlo Ancelotti fits the bill, and so does the man we all expected the hierarchy at City to deliver – Pep Guardiola. When Sheik Mansour arrived at Manchester City he declared that he wanted the club to be winning in Europe. They're still not doing that, and it's about time City went to the next level, for their own good, and for the good of English football. It's like they poked their head out of United's shadow for a few seconds and got burned by the sunshine. Think big City, or forever stay small.","Manchester United 4-2 Manchester City: Click here to read the match report .

970,0ba1dc167831450187cb6bb7dc4da7ba18aea129,"Jurors have started deliberations in the case against a man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, whose 1979 disappearance while on his way to school helped galvanize the national missing-children's movement. Etan Patz 'is larger than his very little, important life,' Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said in closing arguments at the Manhattan murder trial of Pedro Hernandez. She asked jurors to convict Hernandez of murder, saying he was a calculated killer who committed a terrible crime and then spent three decades trying to hide from it. Shira Patz and Stanley Patz, the sister and father of Etan Patz, arrive for court, in New York,  Wednesday: Jurors have started deliberations in the case against Pedro Hernandez . Pedro Hernandez, left, is accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, right, who vanished in 1979 . Hernandez confessed in 2012 in a case that has confounded law enforcement for decades. Etan's body was never found, nor was any trace of clothing or his belongings. He had never been considered a suspect - his name appears only once in law enforcement paperwork at the time Etan disappeared. The defense says the admissions are made up, the ravings of a mentally ill man who sees visions and has a low IQ. A teenage stock clerk at the corner shop, Hernandez knew there were children in and out of the store, and Etan had been there countless times, the prosecutor said. She said Hernandez saw Etan with a dollar and calculated he wanted a drink, so he asked him to the basement. 'Day after day he saw this beautiful little boy,' she said. 'One day, he acted on an impulse and did something terrible to this little boy.' She said the motive was sexual, and Etan likely fought back. 'The quickest and easiest way to shut him up and shut him up permanently was to choke him to death,' she said. Rosemary Hernandez, left, and Becky Hernandez, the wife and daughter of Pedro Hernandez, arrive for court in New York, on Wednesday . Stanley Patz, left, the father of Etan Patz, arrives for court on Wednesday, although his estranged wife Julie, right, hasn't been pictured at court in recent days . Illuzzi-Orbon said his first confession to a prayer group shortly after the boy disappeared was the most accurate - he was confessing to God, and he was trying to unburden himself. Prayer circle members testified that Hernandez made tearful admissions during a 1979 retreat that matched some of what he told authorities on video 33 years later: He gave a child a soda, took him to the store basement and choked him. Two said Hernandez also admitted abusing the boy; when talking to police, Hernandez denied molesting Etan. A former neighbor and his ex-wife also testified he told them about killing someone in New York. The Maple Shade, New Jersey, man made the stunning admissions to police after authorities received a tip from a relative who saw news reports of the case in 2012. Site: Hernandez was working in 1979 at this corner convenience store, near where Etan was last seen where the man said he threw the boy's body into trash . 'I grabbed him by the neck and started choking him,' said Hernandez, now 54. 'I was nervous. My legs were jumping. I wanted to let go, but I just couldn't let go. I felt like something just took over me.' Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein said the confession video shows 'a man sitting there convinced he killed a child - on a day that he doesn't know, at a time he doesn't know, at a location near a bus stop that he doesn't know.' The defense has suggested that the real killer is a convicted pedophile jailed in Pennsylvania who was the longtime suspect in the case. That man, Jose Ramos, denies involvement. However, a former federal prosecutor and FBI agent testified that Ramos told investigators he was '90 percent' sure a boy he took from a park was Etan, and Hernandez's former prison cellmate testified that Ramos admitted molesting the boy. 'Two confessions,' Fishbein said. 'Which person is more likely to have been a predator?' Etan's photo was one of the first on milk cartons. The day he went missing, May 25, became National Missing Children's Day.

Elsewhere, the list of places named after the Queen includes a city in South Australia, British and Australian Antarctica and Queen Elizabeth National Park, which is famous for its beauty and tree-climbing lions, in Uganda. Earlier this week, the Queen appeared unusually nervous and was spotted crossing her fingers as she cheered on her horse in the Royal Box at Newbury.

ISIS entered the Yarmouk camp as Jordan closed its only functioning border crossing with the country following heavy clashes on the Syrian side between rebels and government forces. The militants, who already control large swaths of territory in northern Syria, reportedly entered the camp from the nearby Hajar Aswad neighborhood in southern Damascus in a coordinated attack with their rivals in the Al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. According to the the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, ISIS managed to take control of large parts of the Yarmouk camp following clashes with a Palestinian group. Jihadis: ISIS militants (pictured) entered the Yarmouk camp as Jordan closed its only functioning border crossing with the country following heavy clashes on the Syrian side between rebels and government forces . If ISIS manage to gain full control of Yarmouk, the jihadis can potentially use the camp as a base from which to threaten the heart of the capital as possibly challenge Assad himself. The Palestinian-run refugee camp  has been under government siege for nearly two years. U.N. aid workers have been sending food parcels into the camp, where thousands of civilians remain trapped and in desperate need of food and medicine. The camp had witnessed fighting in the past between government forces and militants who control much of the camp. The Observatory reported heavy clashes in the camp between IS fighters and members of the Palestinian faction called Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis. Residents of the Palestinian-run Yarmouk camp are seen queuing to receive food supplies last year . Anwar Raja, the spokesman for the pro-Assad Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said ISIS fighters entered the camp from nearby Hajar Aswad where they have been based for months. He added that today's push came was coordinated between ISIS and their rivals in the Nusra Front, Al Qaeda's branch in Syria. 'The Nusra Front opened the road for them in order to infiltrate the camp and several hours ago they entered Yarmouk,' Raja said by telephone. It was not immediately clear why Nusra - who have repeatedly fought against ISIS over the past year - would facilitate the entry of the group into the camp. A Syrian foreign ministry statement today said it holds Jordan responsible for 'obstructing the movement of trucks and passengers and any ensuing economic or social repercussions.' U.N relief workers with blue helmets and vests stand next of residents of the Yarmouk camp one year ago . Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said that the Nasib crossing was temporarily closed late last night because of clashes nearby. 'It is important for us to keep the safety for the passengers and those who are trying to cross between the two countries,' he said.

A spokesman for rebels in southern Syria, Issam al-Rayess, confirmed that rebel fighters were trying to take control of the border crossing from Syrian authorities. The Nasib crossing is the only functioning crossing between Jordan and Syria and is considered a crucial gateway for Syria's government and for Syrian, Lebanese and Jordanian traders and merchants.

3003,bf51d9000f7e00bbc02bf4f291c02df9c3faffbd,"Incumbent Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel celebrated Tuesday night a hard-fought victory in a tense run-off race against challenger Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia. Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff notorious for his brusque management style, was forced to campaign furiously across the city to beat Cook County Commissioner Garcia after failing to capture a majority against four other candidates in a February election. The mayoral runoff was the first since the city changed the way it conducts elections about 20 years ago. Scroll down for video . Four more years: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel celebrates a victorious election night at Plumbers Local 130 Union Hall, Tuesday, April 7 . Celebratory smooch: Mayor Emanuel exchanged a kiss with his wife, Amy Rule, as Chicago's first couple reveled in the runoff win . Second City's first family: Emanuel was joined on stage by his family, including (L to R), daughter Leah, wife Amy and son Zachariah . Rahm's entourage: Mayor Emanuel's brothers Ari, left, and Ezekiel Emanuel, smile as they celebrate his victory . ‘To all the voters I want to thank you for putting me through my paces,’ an elated Emanuel told supporters Tuesday night. ‘I will be a better mayor because of that. I will carry your voices, your concerns into ... the mayor's office.’ The 55-year-old mayor ascended the stage at Plumbers Local 130 Union Hall Tuesday night to the sounds of U2's Beautiful Day, accompanied by his wife, Amy Rule, their children and Emanuel's brothers, high-powered Hollywood agent Ari Emanuel and prominent bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel. With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had about 56 per cent of the vote compared to around 44 per cent for his opponent. ‘To all the little boys and girls watching: We didn't lose today, we tried,’ Garcia told his supporters gathered at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ‘We fought hard for what we believed in. You don't succeed at this or anything else unless you try.’ Garcia said he had called Emanuel to concede. The incumbent highlighted tough decisions he's made since succeeding former Mayor Richard M. Daley in 2011, but admitted that his management approach too often rubbed city residents the wrong way. He portrayed Garcia as too inexperienced to handle the city's financial crunch. Gracious: An elated Emanuel thanked voter for putting him through his paces and said he will be a better mayor because of it . All smiles: Mayor Emanuel's supporters were out in full force Tuesday night to celebrate his victory in the runoff . Sizable victory: With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had about 56 per cent of the vote compared to around 44 percent for his opponent . Many of those heading to the polls Tuesday said the election should be a signal. ‘Hopefully he [Emanuel] takes heed of the runoff when he should have been a shoo-in,’ said Richard Rowe, a 50-year-old, who planned to vote for the incumbent. Jesus Fernandez, a 44-year-old window washer who voted for Garcia, had the same view. ‘If he [Garcia] gets close, we might push Rahm to do something,’ Fernandez said. ‘At least we push him a little bit.’ Emanuel raised far more money than Garcia, plastered the airwaves with ads and had support from his former boss, President Obama, who cast an early ballot for him from Washington. The mayor faces huge obstacles in his second term, from fixing the worst-funded pension systems of any big US city to stemming stubborn violence and confronting labor unions that just spent millions trying to defeat him. Chicago's four pension systems are about $20billion in debt, and the fund for Chicago Public Schools teachers is short about $7billion of what's needed to pay benefits as promised. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Sr. waits backstage before Cook County Commissioner Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia gives his concession speech during an election night event at the University of Illinois . Failed bid: Chicago mayoral candidate Jesus 'Chuy' Garcia conceded the runoff election  at the UIC Forum . Garcia told his supporters: 'We didn't lose today, we tried. We fought hard for what we believed in' Garcia's support is seen wiping her eyes while listening to his concession speech Tuesday . If Emanuel can't work a deal with labor unions or get the Illinois Legislature to approve relief, the city is on the hook for an additional $550million payment to the retirement accounts, bringing the total payment to about $1billion. He's said that would be roughly equal to the annual cost of having 4,300 police officers on the street or raising property taxes by 150 percent. Emanuel also must deal with ongoing concerns about crime, one of the areas Garcia hit him on repeatedly during the election. After a spike in homicides early in his first term, the number fell to the lowest level in a half-century though the number of shootings has climbed 12 per cent. ‘I'm proud of what we've accomplished in these past four years, but I understand the challenges we face will require me to approach them differently and to work in a different fashion,’ Emanuel said. ‘The only way to meet these challenges is to bridge the gaps between the things that divide us and start focusing on the things that unite us and bring us together.’ Garcia, a former community organizer, alderman and state lawmaker, ran a campaign focused on the city's neighborhoods, with support from teachers and unions upset with Emanuel.

Tooting her own horn: Ramona Parkman welcomes Mayor Rahm Emanuel to a campaign office Tuesday, April 7, 2015, by blowing a Jewish shofar ram's horn on the south side of Chicago .

He accused the mayor of being out of touch with voters and blamed him for the fiscal problems, while playing up the mayor's push to close about 50 schools and a gang violence problem that spiked during Emanuel's first term. He also vowed to end Chicago's troubled red-light camera system, which some residents believe is discriminatory and focuses more on revenue than safety. Election officials said more than 142,300 Chicago voters cast early ballots for the runoff, far outpacing early voting turnout in February and four years ago.","With nearly all voting precincts reporting results, Emanuel had 55.5 per cent of the vote compared to 44.5 per cent for his opponent .

China, South Korea and Japan have all banned new charter flights of Thai carriers after an audit by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reported that it found 'significant safety concerns' with the country's aviation safety to Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation. According to CASA, Thai Airways is the only Thai airline that regularly operates in Australia. Scroll down for video . UN's International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reported to Thailand's Department of Civil Aviation that it found 'significant safety concerns' with the country's aviation safety . The regulator claims to have made contact with the airline and the Thai aviation safety regulator for 'further detailed information'. 'CASA has increased the number of ramp inspections of Thai Airways flights operating into Australia. These inspections look at the condition of aircraft as well as flight and aircraft documentation,' a statement from the government body said, according to Crikey. 'At this stage CASA has not placed any additional restrictions on Thai Airways flights to and from Australia. 'This is subject to the results of increased surveillance and any additional information that may be provided by Thai Airways and the Thai air safety regulator. While some countries have now banned new charter flights from any Thai airlines, Australia has 'increased the number of ramp inspections of Thai Airways flights operating into Australia'. According to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, 'these inspections look at the condition of aircraft as well as flight and aircraft documentation' 'Any request for additional flights by Thai Airways or changes to their currently approved operations will be considered in the light of the issues raised by the International Civil Aviation Organization and CASA's surveillance and safety checks.' Amongst the country's airlines that have been affected by bans are Thai Airways and budget airlines Thai AirAsia X, NokScoot and Asia Atlantic Airline. Audits assess a country's overall ability to ensure aviation safety.

A chess grandmaster has been thrown out of an international tournament and faces a 15-year ban after he was caught sneaking to the toilet to check moves on his mobile phone. Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page . When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence, Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages. Tournaments sanctioned by the International Chess Federation - including the Dubai Open - do not allow players to carry mobile phones and other electronic devices during matches.","Gaioz Nigalidze has been expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament .

The Oscar nominated actress, 60, revealed she turned down the starring role alongside James Gandolfini in the landmark HBO drama because she had already played a mobster's wife in Goodfellas, nine years previously. Accusing Chase of lazy casting, Bracco chose instead the complicated role of Dr. Melfi, who provided the therapy that allowed New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano to justify many of his monstrous acts. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Lorraine Bracco said that she was first approached to play the role of Carmela in The Sopranos and not Dr. Jennifer Melfi . Speaking to Huffington Post Live, Bracco explained how she convinced Chase to change his mind. 'I fell in love with David (Chase) the minute I met him, when I walked into the room. 'I said, 'I like this guy. And I said, 'Look, I don't think I should play Carmela because I did it, I did it in a Scorsese movie, I got an Oscar nomination. 'I really don't think I'm going to bring so much to this for you that I haven't done already,' she told HuffPost Live on Monday. What could have been: Lorraine Bracco wanted to play Dr. Jennifer Melfi (left) but was originally asked by show creator David Chase to play Carmela Soprano. He cast Edie Falco (right) instead . Oscar nominated: Lorraine Bracco starred opposite Ray Liotta in Goodfellas in 1990. The Martin Scorsese mob drama is recognized as one of the greatest movies in that genre . Obviously not wanting to count herself out of what became arguably the best television drama ever made, Bracco asked to play the character of Dr. Melfi instead. 'I said, 'But I really love this script, and I want to play Mefli.' ... And he agreed with me that I'd done it already and it wasn't really incredible creative casting for him. He said, 'You want to play Melfi?' And I said, 'Yeah, I want to play Mefli'' So I left on that, and he gave it to me.' Speaking about the untimely death of James Gandolfini in 2013, Bracco said his passing was devastating and a wake up call. 'Well yea. My parents died nine days apart and then later Jimmy passed and Jimmy is a decade younger than me,' said Bracco to HuffPost Live. Soprano's stars: Edie Falco, James Gandolfini and Lorraine Bracco at the launch of the show's fifth season in New York City in 2005 . 'I always teased him, 'You gotta get rid of that belly' and he would say, 'Oh, it's pure muscle!' said Bracco. 'But yea, it (his death) was devastating.

She told Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey: ‘I don’t get to give this one out very often. Did you ever imagine you’d be standing here? Well done.’ But in fact the 27-year-old is the second member of his family to receive the highest military decoration for valour – a cousin was given the honour 70 years ago. Scroll down for video . The Queen awards a Victoria Cross to Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey, who showed immense bravery by drawing enemy fire and helping his comrades before taking the fight to the Taliban in August 2013 . It is just the sixth time the Queen has given a VC to a living, British recipient during her reign . L/Cpl Leakey said he was 'uncomfortable' about being singled out ahead of others in his regiment and insisted the battle was 'just one job, one patrol out of multiple patrols' L/Cpl Leakey is only the sixth living British soldier the Queen has presented with his medal. He was invested in a ceremony at Windsor Castle. L/Cpl Leakey, of 1 Para, is the third British serviceman to receive the VC for bravery during the Afghanistan campaign but the other two awards were made posthumously. In 2013, he braved heavy gunfire from 20 Taliban insurgents in Helmand to rush to the aid of a wounded US Marine. He also took control of a machine gun post to begin the fightback, then ran down a barren hillside, dodging a hail of bullets, picked up another machine gun and continued the battle in which 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. According to the official citation, L/Cpl Leakey, who is single and from Hampshire, showed ‘complete disregard for his own safety’ as his unit came under attack for around an hour. The Paratrooper shared a brief exchange with the Queen as he was awarded the honour at Windsor Castle. He said the Queen told him: 'I don't get to give this one out very often' Special medal: The VC can be awarded to all ranks of the services - and also to civilians - to recognise gallantry in the presence of the enemy . Lance Corporal Leakey showed 'complete disregard' for his own safety during the firefight in August 2013 . It added: ‘Displaying gritty leadership well above that expected of his rank, Lance Corporal Leakey’s actions single-handedly regained the initiative and prevented considerable loss of life, allowing a wounded officer to be evacuated.’ Speaking after the investiture, L/Cpl Leakey said: ‘It’s such a great honour and massively humbling to be put among all those people who have received the VC in the past. ‘My family are very proud and happy but the lads in the battalion know this isn’t something you seek out. ‘You just do what you deem necessary on the day and any one of them could be standing where I am today. ‘It’s great for my family, my friends, my regiment – but it does for me highlight the sacrifice everyone’s made in Afghan, not just in terms of the loss of life and limbs but people going away for months on end.’ His parents, Rosemary and Mark Leakey, who saw him receive his medal from the Queen, said: ‘It’s been a very emotional, a very moving occasion. 'We’re just so delighted that Josh is here in one piece to receive the honour with his family and all the Paras, especially when you hear that so many VCs are awarded posthumously. ‘We were particularly pleased his grandparents were able to be here too – three generations together and representing all three services: Royal Navy with his grandfather, RAF father and Josh the Army.’ Emotional: Lance Corporal Leakey being hugged by Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter (right), after he was named as being awarded the VC at Lancaster House in London in February . L/Cpl Leakey is the second member of his family to receive the award, following his second cousin twice removed, Nigel Leakey (right), who fought in the Second World War . Proud family: (L-R) Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey's uncle Lieutenant General David Leakey, the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, alongside his brother Ben, mother Rosie and father Mark in Westminster . The wounded US Marine who L/Cpl Leakey rescued described how the Para ran through a hail of machine gunfire to save him. Captain Brandon Bocian said: ‘I hadn’t met L/Cpl Leakey prior to that day but am grateful for his actions. The fact that he chose to leave his position to help me speaks of his courage and character. I am happy to hear that he is being formally recognised.’ L/Cpl Leakey’s distant cousin Sergeant Nigel Gray Leakey received the VC posthumously for his gallantry in an attack on Italian tanks in East Africa in 1941. The 28-year-old, who was serving in the King’s African Rifles, leapt on a tank, wrenched open the turret and shot dead the crew but was killed trying to repeat the feat on another tank. Born in Kenya, he was the son of Arundell Gray Leakey – a cousin of Louis Leakey, the prominent Kenyan archaeologist. According to the official citation, the 1 Para hero showed 'complete disregard for his own safety' as the force came under attack from around 20 insurgents armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades in Helmand province. The firefight lasted for around an hour. 'Displaying gritty leadership well above that expected of his rank, Lance Corporal Leakey's actions single-handedly regained the initiative and prevented considerable loss of life, allowing a wounded officer to be evacuated,' the citation said. A US Marine Corps captain was shot and wounded and the force's communications had gone down. First, Lance Corporal Leakey dashed across a barren hillside which was being raked with enemy fire and undeterred by the 'very clear and present danger', he gave first aid to the wounded officer. But with the 'snap and crack' of enemy fire all around him, he realised that two of his group's machine gun teams had been surrounded.

Despite being the most junior member of the force he took control of the situation and began the casualty evacuation. He went back up the hill and took control of one of the machine guns – with bullets ricocheting off the gun's frame – before running down again, drawing enemy fire. His 'courageous' action spurred those around him to fight back with renewed ferocity. But the firefight continued. Lance Corporal Leakey, 'with the full knowledge of the dangers', exposed himself to Taliban fire once more. Weighed down with 60lb of equipment, he ran to the bottom of the hill, picked up a second machine gun and climbed back up the hill. Drawing the majority of enemy fire, with rounds flying past his head, he opened fire. Then he handed over the machine gun to a comrade and supervised the evacuation of the wounded officer. During the battle 11 insurgents were killed and four wounded. The Marine officer made a full recovery.","Joshua Leakey receives sixth VC Queen has given to a living UK recipient .

5958,2ec6b36c84e633e329895b7f4780814b5331a4eb,"A retired Calgary couple who were attacked by pirates during a sailing trip in Honduras two weeks ago said they're grateful to be alive after the terrifying incident. Loretta Reinholdt, 54, and Andy Wasinger, 46, were on their second day into a trip from Belize to the Honduran island of Roatan in which they were learning to sail on a 17-meter-long hired boat with a captain when they were attacked. Four men with guns and knives boarded the sailboat and took all of their money after waving down the sailboat by asking for gas. Reinholdt (left) and Wasinger (right) were on a hired sailboat with a captain two weeks ago when four men waved them down, boarded the boat with guns and knives and demanded money before pushing their boat to the shore of a remote beach, leaving the couple and captain stranded for four days . 'They were yelling,' Reinholdt, a former nurse, told CBC. 'They were demanding more money. They didn't believe we only had that amount. And the more angry they got, the more scary it was. 'And they actually had me, pulling my hair and a knife on my throat, demanding more money from the captain.' Wasinger, a former computer programmer, added: 'I knew we had to comply with the pirates and not be heroes.' After the terrifying hold-up, the pirates pushed the sailboat to the shoreline of a remote beach in Jeanette Kawas National Park, cut the main sail and tore out the engine wire, leaving the couple and their captain stranded. They also took gasoline, the radio and drinking water from the boat. The couple and captain made SOS messages with branches along a park trail, which was discovered by hikers four days later. 'It was great. It was one of the best moments of my life, I think. I was ecstatic,' Wasinger told CTV News. 'I know we can go through anything in life now after this situation. We are a lot closer as a couple and we live life every day as if it is our last.' During their time in the jungle, they survived on rainwater, peanut butter and cheese and make a make-shift tent to stay in until they were saved. 'We hugged each other, we cried,' Reinholdt told CBS. 'And we couldn't thank them enough for doing this for us, because they were also brave that they actually came to the area. So, it's unbelievable. We were so happy to be alive.' Their rescuers took trio to the town to Tela, where they met Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who happened to be staying in the area.

Likewise, Arsenal were exploring the idea of playing additional matches in either India or Malaysia after their initial trip to Singapore - but have decided against it, a decision Wenger is happy with.

2210,0729d93fe8dec6b337d41d96267f284836388786,"Landlord: Despite attacking right to buy, Emily Thornberry has three homes . A senior Labour politician was under fire last night for attacking right to buy – while renting out a property she bought from a housing association. Emily Thornberry has come out against David Cameron’s pledge to extend the right to buy policy from council tenants to those in housing association homes. But eight years ago she and her husband bought at auction a housing association property now worth almost £1million. Tories said Miss Thornberry, who lost her frontbench job after tweeting a sneering picture of a house covered in England flags and with a white van outside, opposed right to buy but not ‘right to buy to let’. ‘This hypocrisy goes right to the heart of Ed Miliband’s Islington-based, out-of-touch Labour Party,’ said Henry Smith, who is seeking re-election as Conservative MP for Crawley. ‘They speak out against plans that help the aspirations of hardworking people on days when it’s politically useful.’ Housing association chiefs have also been accused of hypocrisy for drawing huge salaries and living in mansions while wishing to deny tenants a foot on the property ladder. Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, has a£1million home in fashionable Islington, north London. Miss Thornberry yesterday retweeted an article from the federation attacking right to buy. And, in a question-and-answer session last week, the Labour candidate for Islington South and Finsbury criticised the policy directly. She said: ‘I don’t have a problem per se with people being able to buy their council flat or council house, so long as it is replaced like for like. 'And that’s what the problem has been. There has been a massive sell-off but they have not been replaced.’ Council house tenants in England can already buy their home at a discount of up to £103,900. The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all. Around 2.7million people live in these properties. The subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties when they become vacant. Each would be replaced on a one-for-one basis. The picture that cost Miss Thornberry her job as shadow attorney general was taken during the Rochester by-election, which was won by Ukip. The case highlighted just how much high-value property Miss Thornberry owned. Costly tweet: Emily Thornberry lost her frontbench job after tweeting this picture, with the sneering caption 'Image from #Rochester' while on the campaign trail in Medway, Kent . She lives with her husband, high court judge Sir Christopher Nugee, in a four-storey Victorian townhouse on an exclusive crescent in Barnsbury, north London, worth almost £3million. Emily Thornberry was forced to resign from the shadow cabinet in November after sneering at a home with St George’s flags hung outside and a white van on the drive. She said she had ‘never seen anything like it’ after tweeting a photo of the terraced home while on the campaign trail for the Rochester and Strood by-election in Kent. The then-shadow attorney general, who lives in a £3million north London house, wrote mockingly alongside the photo: ‘Image from Rochester.’ At first she tried to defend her remarks but was told to quit within hours of the tweet. The home’s owner, cage fighter Dan Ware, 37, branded her a ‘snob’. Speaking at the time, leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Respect is a basic rule of politics and I’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect.’ Miss Thornberry also owns a £600,000 flat in Guildford, Surrey, which she bought for her mother in 2000. In March 2007, her husband bought the housing association property in Finsbury at auction for £572,000. The three-storey townhouse was bought from Ujima, a housing association catering largely for ethnic minority tenants, which went bust just months later. It is now let. The fact a housing association sells a property does not necessarily mean social housing stock has fallen. They could use the cash to build in a cheaper area. During part of her childhood, Miss Thornberry lived in a council house. At the age of seven, her parents divorced and she and her two younger brothers moved into social housing with their mother. Labour politicians continued to attack the right to buy extension yesterday. David Lammy, a potential London mayoral candidate, tweeted: ‘Extending right to buy is one of the most senseless and irresponsible pledges ever made by a British political party.’ Last night a YouGov poll for the Policy Exchange think-tank suggested 50 per cent back extended right to buy. Housing fat cat who hates right to buy is a Labour supporter with £1m home . Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a £1million house in Islington, London . The leading critic of Conservative Party plans to give housing association tenants a right to buy herself lives in a £1million house. As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. In reality she has been one of the country’s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an ‘urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur’, bought a large terrace house in Islington for £440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than £1million in value. Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend ‘right to buy’ legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to ‘some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She added: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Miss Davison’s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: ‘The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many – I couldn’t afford to buy my home now. ‘We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.’","Emily Thornberry has criticised Conservative 'right-to-buy' policy .

Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a compulsory purchase clause that triggered a permanent move to the Mestalla as soon as he played for the La Liga club. Reports in Spain on Thursday suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. VIDEO Scroll down to see Negredo practice his rabonas . Manchester City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo . Negredo didn't celebrate after scoring against Levante on Monday, sparking speculation about his future . There had been suggestions that Valencia were trying to finance a deal for Radamel Falcao . The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao who is set to leave Manchester United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim, and offloading Negredo was seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. Meanwhile, City had scouts watching FC Porto’s surprise 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

The plane began to plunge after it was struck by lightning, but autopilot ignored the pilot’s commands to climb and tried to crash the plane into the sea. The airliner pitched down, falling at 9,500ft a minute, and fell to just 1,100ft above the ocean before its commander wrestled back control just moments before it was about to crash into the icy water. The Loganair flight was just seconds from crashing into the north sea before its commander saved the day . The 42-year-old pilot put out a Mayday emergency signal before regaining control and saving his 30 passengers and three crew just moments before the plane plunged into the sea. The island-hopping Loganair flight from Aberdeen to Shetland was put off its approach by thunderstorms, snow, hail and 70mph winds on the evening of December 15. A ball of lightning then appeared outside the cockpit and a lightning bolt struck the Saab 2000 plane’s nose, and then travelled the full length of the aircraft before leaving its tail. The aircraft landed safely in Aberdeen with only minor damage and no injuries. An AAIB probe discovered that the autopilot on the Loganair Saab 2000 G-LGNO had remained engaged and the pilot’s actions were countered by the system, causing the dive. No technical problems were found with the aircraft, which is now back in service, and pilot training is now included simulations of the incident according to the AAIB report.","Loganair Aberdeen to Shetland flight struck by lightning on approach .

But the grey car he is accused of using to transport the bodies has been lost, Bristol Crown Court was told. Prosecutors have been accused of losing a Nissan Micra (similar to the one shown here) at the centre of a double murder case . Timothy Crook (pictured) is alleged to have murdered his elderly parents Bob, 90, and Elsie, 83, and then driven their bodies 150 miles in a grey Nissan Micra . Sarah Jones, representing Crook, 50, said the blunder could have forensic consequences for his case. Crook is accused of killing his parents at their home in Swindon in July 2007 and then driving their bodies to Lincoln, where they used to live. Ms Jones told Judge Neil Ford QC at a preliminary hearing: 'The car in which the bodies were transported to Lincoln has been lost. 'That may have forensic consequences. We have some forensic angles being looked at. 'I have simply been told the Crown don't know where the car is. If it is not available it would be of help to have an identical model.

We don't investigate the case, we can't be in possession of the car.' Wiltshire Police said the car was not lost, but did not know where it was exactly. A spokesman said: 'The vehicle has not been lost, we understand it to be in the North of England. 'But I believe there was a conversation in court around whether or not it would need to be brought back for further forensics etc.' Crook appeared at the plea and case management hearing via video link from Rampton Hospital and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty to the two murder charges. He is accused of murdering both parents between July 6 and 12, 2007. Some 49 witnesses are expected to be called at the trial which is provisionally set to open on July 6 and last up to four weeks.

10464,cbb8e7d3e222c19388cb42a2b73262b04e8491cb,"(CNN)People have long underestimated the athleticism necessary for golf. But over the last decade, with fit golfers like Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, and now Jordan Spieth all winning the Masters, the training perspective on golf is shifting. There's a particular emphasis on the functional movement required to execute the perfect swing, which is why yoga is increasingly appealing to golfers. During the Masters, Spieth demonstrated optimal movement in two key areas that enhance swing power and fluid control while decreasing the risk of back and knee injuries: mid-back mobility and internal hip rotation. Equally important, he did it while maintaining a stable low back and integrated core strength as the foundation for expressing his swing mobility. Related: Yoga for triathletes . Remember Tiger Wood's low-back problem earlier this year? Tiger blamed a lack of glute (primary buttock muscle) firing for locking up his back, but attempting to rotate from his low back instead of moving functionally from his mid back or hips likely exacerbated the issue. When golfers have mobility limitations in their mid back or hips, they compensate with their low back and knees, which not only hampers play but often leads to pain and injury. Want the mobility to swing like Spieth and avoid the back and knee issues that commonly plague golfers? Try these three yoga-based moves I use with my PGA clients to address the key areas of the swing. Trains internal hip rotation; stabilizes and lengthens lower back muscles; stretches upper back and shoulders; encourages ankle mobility . Start in a neutral all-fours position with your hips over your knees and your shoulders above your wrists. Engage your deep core muscles to stabilize your low back. Extend your right leg straight out to the side with your toes pointing forward and the sole of your foot down. Exhale as you sit your hips back toward your heels as far as you can go comfortably without knee, hip or back pain. Inhale as you bring your body weight forward again and internally rotate from your right hip to come up onto your toes (as pictured). Be sure the rotation is coming from your hip, not your lower back, knees or ankles. Exhale and return your hips back towards your heels and the sole of your foot to the floor. Repeat the movement in synch with your breathing through five repetitions on each side. Promotes proper mid-back extension; strengthens shoulder girdle, opens front of shoulders and chest; lengthens low back . Lie prone (belly down) on your forearms with your elbows under your shoulders. Exhale as you press down through your forearms as though you are trying to slide your belly through your arms to create length in your low back. At the same time, move your shoulder blades down toward your waist. This will activate the mid-back muscles essential for thoracic spine extension while inhibiting the muscles of your upper neck and chest that limit mobility. Hold the posture for three long, deep breaths. Rest for a breath or two and repeat for a total of three holds. Promotes thoracic spine rotation and shoulder girdle function; stabilizes low back; activates glutes (primary muscles of the buttocks); encourages ankle mobility, strengthens adductors (groins), core and legs . Stand with your feet together; your big toes should touch but allow space between your heels to avoid externally rotating your hips. Exhale as you sit back into a squat with your hands and forearms together in front of your chest. Inhale as you hold the position, ensuring that your low back doesn't arch, and your glutes and core are activated for support. Exhale as you rotate from your mid back to place your inside elbow on the top or outside of one leg. Keep your hips and low back stable. Avoid separating your knees or letting one drop forward. Inhale as you use your bottom elbow for leverage to reach your top elbow upward while pulling your hands toward the center of your chest. Exhale as you focus on dropping your shoulder blades down your back and rotating from your mid back. You can look up or down—whatever is comfortable for your neck. Hold the twist for two more breaths. Repeat on the opposite side. As an advanced option, you can hold one of your clubs (as pictured), reaching your top hand up the club during the twist to open your shoulder and chest. Adding these yoga-based moves to your workouts will help you develop the mobility for an optimal swing. But it's up to you to add skill to the movement. To that end, there are many golf trainers who focus on body mechanics with skill training. According to its website, the Titleist Performance Institute (TPI) educates instructors on ""how a properly functioning body allows a player to swing a golf club in the most efficient way possible."" So, if you really want to swing like Spieth, you might consider hiring a TPI-certified trainer since the training staff Spieth thanked during his Masters victory speech were all TPI certified.","During the Masters, Jordan Spieth demonstrated optimal movement to enhance swing power and fluid control .

For more than 30 years, Pat Senior, 66,  has shared her five-bedroom home in Bolton, Greater Manchester, with the animals, taking in dogs from as far afield as Romania and Hungary. She estimates that she spends £240 a week on food and treats for the dogs, with veterinary bills adding another £17,000 to the yearly cost of caring for the pets. Pat Senior, 66,  (pictured) who is nicknamed the 'Fairy Dogmother', spends more than £28,000 a year looking after as many as 26 stray or abandoned dogs she has welcomed into her home . Grandmother-of-four Mrs Senior and her businessman husband, Charles, currently have 19 dogs in their care, including lurchers, German Shepherds and Chinese Cresteds who all sleep and live at her home. She has made makeshift beds for the animals in the couple's garage, with some dogs sleeping in the living room, although three Chinese Cresteds are allowed to sleep in her bed. She takes in neglected greyhounds as well as adopting dogs from pounds, and at one stage had 26 dogs living under her roof. Mrs Senior spends £240 a week on food and treats for the dogs, with veterinary bills adding another £17,000 to the yearly cost of caring for the pets . As well as taking in neglected greyhounds, Mrs Senior also adopts dogs from her local dog pounds and at one stage had 26 dogs living under her roof. She describes meal times as 'chaotic', with her shopping list consisting of 40 small chickens a week for the smaller and medium sized dogs, and two large packs of minced chicken and pasta a day for the larger animals. 'I wake at 6.30am and it's nonstop from then on,' said Mrs Senior. 'We feed the dogs at dinner time and then they get a big dinner in the evening. It's a mad rush and chaotic with dog bowls all over the place and we make sure every dog gets its dinner. They are here there and everywhere. I also take the only four fit enough to walk out. I also clean.' Mrs Senior, who is also a painter, left behind her career as a singer to look after the animals after a chance encounter with a woman trying to rehome a stray lurcher, Lexus, in 1981. Within a few weeks she became inundated with calls from greyhound owners wanting her to take the dogs off their hands and so set up the Angels With Furry Coats dog rescue, which is run entirely from her home. She says was then asked to work undercover for a BBC documentary to 'expose the dark side of grey hound racing,' and was horrified to see greyhounds drugged with heroine and living in squalor. She then made it her mission to open her home to as many neglected dogs as she could, and last year had eight stray hounds brought over from Romania and Hungary at a cost of £350 per animal. Due to the poor condition of many of her dogs her veterinary bill amounts to around £17,000 a year. 'I have been told I am completely mad and I could have brought many properties with all that money but I would rather be me than someone doing nothing,' she said. 'Somebody has got to look after these dogs and not everyone can. They like holidays and an easy life. Mrs Senior and one of her Angels With Furry Coats volunteers, Lorraine, walk some of the rescued dogs . As well as taking in neglected greyhounds, the grandmother-of-four also adopts dogs from her local dog pounds and at one stage had 26 dogs living under her roof . 'People were calling and saying if you don't take the dog I will kill it. I decided this is what I am going to do for the rest of my life. 'I had no idea what was happening before. I had to deal with owners who would regularly give the dogs heroine. They would have all these dogs hopped up on drugs and off their heads. I was really disgusted. I saw a picture of some hanging by their necks from trees.' 'If I think about it I could have had a pretty good lifestyle if I hadn't spent all this money on the dogs. But I do it because you see these sad cases and when you manage to turn it around it is so worth it.' Mrs Senior, who is also a painter, left behind her career as a singer to look after the animals after a chance encounter with a woman trying to rehome a stray lurcher, Lexus, in 1981 . The mother-of-two says she is rushed off her feet all day, especially as she likes 'to live in a nice house and not a kennel.' She added: 'I have a lovely home and everything has to be spotless. People are gobsmacked that we have a beautiful house. We do not live in a dog kennel.' Many of the dogs that come into Mrs Senior's care are in bad condition and she says she loves getting them back in shape. 'Many of them are flea bitten or emaciated,' she said. 'But some have been garrotted, had fat poured all over them, burnt with cigarettes and some have even be sexually abused.

A bigamist was caught out when his first wife discovered his secret second marriage – on Facebook. 'Shameless liar' Andrew O'Clee, 36, wed Michelle Agbulos – and later tied the knot again with another woman. But Michelle, 39, uncovered the deception when she came across footage of him completing the ice bucket charity challenge on the social networking site. Serial cheat O'Clee had tried to cover his tracks by claiming he was involved in a fraud case and had been put into the witness protection programme which meant he had to live in a 'safe house' for long periods. Blinded by her belief in his honesty, Michelle allowed herself to be taken in by his elaborate lies, agreeing not to tell her family and friends what was happening. Yesterday the former soldier was jailed for eight months after a court heard about the web of 'lies and forgery' lasting four years. O'Clee tied the knot with first wife Michelle in 2008. But while they were trying for a baby together, he had already started his double life with a new woman. He later turned up at the birth of his daughter, Amelia, and cut the umbilical cord – before telling his wife he had to leave with a police escort. But instead of heading to a so-called safe house, he would leave their rented flat in Ealing, West London to go back to finance manager Philippa Campbell in upmarket Chiddingfold, Surrey – a 40-mile journey away. He started the affair with Philippa after claiming his first marriage had ended after he caught shopworker Michelle being unfaithful. He married again in August 2013 – even forging divorce documents so his family would attend the second wedding. O'Clee's lavish illegal nuptials took place in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex, before the reception at Russets Country House, near their detached £575,000 home. He began his affair with his second wife Philippa (right) in 2011 - while he and his first wife were trying for a baby, pictured together outside Chichester Crown Court yesterday . His first wife Michelle (pictured) revealed that he showed up late at the birth of their child and said he had to leave with police . But the deception was uncovered last August when Michelle discovered a video of him on Facebook completing the ice bucket challenge – where people are filmed being drenched in freezing water for charity. It was captioned 'Uncle Andrew and Auntie Philippa'. The post led her to photos of his second wedding, which she reported to police. Yesterday O'Clee was jailed after admitting bigamy at Chichester Crown Court. But second wife Philippa, 30, has vowed to stay with him. 2000: Andrew O'Clee met Michelle . 2008: The pair married in West Acton in 2008 . 2011: Couple began trying for a baby around the same time he started affair with Philippa . 2012: O'Clee got engaged to Philippa and forged a decree absolute for his first marriage . 2013: He married Philippa in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex . 2014: Michelle and Andrew's daughter was born . 2014: O'Clee was arrested in September . Judge Christopher Parker, QC, told O'Clee: 'You began to develop a complicated and absurd lie. 'All of which was a complete nonsense but it enabled you to lead a double life. 'Bigamy is an offence against the institution of marriage, an institution founded on complete trust. This was simply a selfish act.' To avoid detection, O'Clee told Michelle he had been placed in witness protection and had to live in a safe house as his life was in danger. She told the court: 'Thinking back, as I do every single minute of every single day, I had no reason not to trust Andrew. 'I was told he would have to be taken to a safe house with his colleagues for his and my own safety. 'He was taken to a safe house every night and I wasn't allowed to know the location. 'I was told by him not to tell my family or friends. I became paranoid and constantly fearful for my safety. 'Looking back I feel completely stupid and naive for not thinking something was wrong. I believed my life was in danger.' Michelle went into labour 18 months after he began his safe-house lie. The bigamist married his second wife in August 2013, pictured is Philippa's Facebook page with a photograph from their wedding . The bigamist has since deleted his Facebook page and removed the incriminating Ice Bucket Challenge video . But O'Clee took five hours to turn up – and then cut the umbilical cord before saying he had to leave with police. She added: 'The day I found out about the bigamy was the day my world fell apart and the violent betrayal unfolded. Bigamy is a crime under section 57 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. If someone is caught entering into another marriage whilst still being legally married and is convicted on indictment, they could face a fine or a jail term of up to seven years. A custodial sentence can be ordered when one party has been deceived and suffered injury or if the offence has been committed for money to evade immigration. 'To add insult to injury he instructed me to take a paternity test.' Defending, Patrick Duffy said O'Clee – who worked for business services provider ISS – has 'abandonment issues' because his parents split when he was 15. He said second wife Philippa planned to continue her relationship with him and wished 'to draw a line under this and get on with her life'. O'Clee admitted to one count of bigamy and is expected to serve half of his sentence in custody. Michelle is currently staying with her sister Jasmine Agbulus and her partner Sean in a house in Lancashire and refused to comment about her two-timing husband. She used to live in a rented flat in Ealing, West London, with O'Clee and the landlord became so suspicious of his behaviour that he hired a private investigator to check on the pair. O'Clee told Michelle he was in Witness Protection as his life was in danger and then moved into a new house in Chiddingfold, Surrey, (pictured) with Philippa . His illegal wedding to Philippa took place in St John the Baptist church in Kirdford, West Sussex, in 2013 . The owners were alerted to the fact that nobody was living in the flat when neighbours complained about a foul smell coming from the property - which turned out to be rotting food in the fridge. A spokesperson for the letting agents said: 'I'm glad that he's been caught out. We knew there was something strange going on. 'The fact he didn't want us speaking to his wife was very weird. 'We got in touch with Philippa and she said, 'Yes that's my husband' but she knew nothing about the flat. 'He called us and said, 'Don't speak to Philippa anymore it's a sensitive matter.' O'Clee cleared out all their belongings, including his old army uniforms, from the flat in October last year, according to the spokesman. Neighbours living at the block of flats in Ealing said they remember Michelle, as well as her 'energetic' husband. One neighbour said: 'Yes I heard he had multiple wives. He was always on the go and very energetic.' Another added: 'Michelle used to live here. She would always say hi when I saw her in the street. It's awful what he did to her.' O'Clee and Philippa celebrated their wedding reception at Russets Country House, near their Surrey home .","Andrew O'Clee, 36, met first wife Michelle in 2000 and they married in 2008 .

Looking radiant, Daphne Selfe, 86, shows off the collaboration between the footwear super-brand and the ethereal high street store with uncompromising grace. Daphne said of the collection, in which she appears with 22-year-old Flo Dron: 'The & Other Stories’ collection that is featured in this story is truly relaxed and timeless with a modern twist, all in lovely colours.' 86-year-old Daphne Selfe has starred in the campaign for Vans and & Other Stories alongside Flo Dunn, 22 . The images show the new footwear which sees Stories make a twist on the classic vans slip on. The shoes are then worn with pieces from the brands SS2015 collection. Daphne's career originally began  in 1949 and she once told the Express: 'Modelling was respectable then so my parents were very happy for me to do it and it was fabulous. 'I still think the Fifties was the best time to be a model because the clothes were so lovely. Of course we were much more innocent. 'There was no television, only the radio and we'd never heard of drugs.' At the time of the interview in 2011 Daphne, from Baldock, Hertfordshire, was still commanding £1,000 per day for her work. Daphne looks cool and relaxed as she models the & Other Stories collection alongside the customised shoes . 'That rate is quite rare but it's very nice when it comes and helps the pension,' she said. The model also comes from a time when it was OK to not be super skinny: 'I'm a big-boned person and back in 1950 I was 10st 7lb, although nobody told me to lose weight. 'I didn't do anything to make myself thin but once I had three children I lost weight and now I'm 8st. 'My waist is 28'' so I can sometimes get into a size eight on a shoot but I wear a 10 for comfort. I think it's ridiculous and very sad that some of the models now have become so skeletal.' Flo and Daphne sit side by side as they model almost matching outfits for the two brands . Daphne wears a day time look with lace up vans (left) changing into a red dress for another picture (right) The model has never had any surgery and shies away from botox. She once said: 'I’ve never had anything done to my face. 'Not that poison [botox], not a facelift. I think it’s a waste of money. Anyway, I couldn’t afford it!’ She previously revealed to the MailOnline that she posed nude back in the day for artists such as Barbara Hepworth. The outfits chosen for the campaign look great no matter what age the model is . She revealed that she keeps her grey hair, which is brushed down around her shoulders in the new campaign, long because it is cheaper. She said: 'My hair is long now because it’s cheaper, I don’t have to do anything, but put it in a topknot or a French pleat. 'It avoids that old lady permed look, lengthens the neck and lifts the face. I’ve got so many friends who don’t touch the make-up pot. You should keep looking nice, it makes you feel so much better.’ In modelling shots taken from the earlier part of her career Daphne shows off her effortless grace . Daphne is known for her timeless beauty and has previously admitted to never having had any surgery . Daphne took part in the Dare To Wear campaign in 2014 for the Trafford Center in Manchester . Over the last few years Daphne has landed a number of campaigns with well known brands. In 2013 she was chosen to work for TK Maxx and last year she fronted the Dare To Wear campaign for the Trafford Center in Manchester. Daphne says that she has good genes and maintains a healthy lifestyle: 'My parents gave me good genes and health, and I have always eaten sensibly. 'I was brought up through the war so the phrase ""make do and mend"" has never done me any harm. I always try to make the best of everything, to stay positive and to have a healthy lifestyle.'

The drama, commissioned by the Customs and Border Security Agency, will reportedly have a story-line which involves the Australian Navy and asylum seekers drowning at sea.

The telemovie will be shown in countries such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan later in the year, urging asylum seekers not to trust people smugglers . An Immigration Department spokesperson would not clarify whether the government will fully fund the drama. However the spokesperson told Lateline that 'television soap operas and telemovies are proven media to reach the target audience when seeking to deliver complex messages'. 'Each broadcast will be accompanied by a major awareness campaign across television and social media,' the spokesperson said. Producing the show will be Sydney company Put It Out There Pictures. This comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated that only the Coalition would be able to stop asylum seeker boats . Despite the multi-million dollar funding, Phil Glendenning - president of Refugee Council of Australia -  told Lateline that he has doubts the show will discourage people from countries like Afghanistan and Syria. 'A TV show isn't going to stop people who are running from the Taliban,' he said. Mr Glendenning says the government should instead use the funds to help the United Nations High Commission for Refugees give asylum seekers better security. This comes as Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated that only the Coalition would be able to stop asylum seeker boats, the Guardian reports. 'I'm also confident that only this government can keep them stopped because any other government, I suspect, would quickly succumb to the cries of the human rights lawyers and others and what that would mean, very quickly, is that the people smugglers would be back in business,' he said on Thursday.","The Australian government will make a multi-million dollar telemovie .

7538,206a99253dafc0701ad7e707dc8648c1fe6cce92,"Bournemouth are set to hold off on expanding the capacity of their 12,000-seater Goldsands Stadium - as a tactic to help them next season. The away contingent are currently crammed into a corner of the ground between the South Stand and the East Stand. Manager Eddie Howe prefers the away fans not to be behind one of the goals to give his players a psychological advantage when they are playing in front of a home crowd. Bournemouth will not look to increase the capacity of their 12,000-seater Goldsands Stadium . Premier League rules state clubs must give the away fans 10 per cent of their overall allocation . Bournemouth officials are considering doubling the South Stand from its current 2,500 seats to 5,000, taking the whole capacity to just less than 15,000. However, Premier League regulations state that clubs must provide at least 10 per cent of their overall allocation of tickets for away supporters. This would mean that, should Bournemouth press ahead with the expansion, away fans might then have to be positioned behind one of the goals - against Howe’s wishes. Last year, the possibility of increasing the stadium to 18,000 by filling in all four corners was discussed, but the logistics of that make it unlikely. Just to expand the South Stand would cost the club £1.8million and, over the course of a season, they would only accrue £900,000 in ticket sales. Any construction would, therefore, be for the benefit of fans as opposed to any financial advantage. Manager Eddie Howe is reluctant to change the position of the away fans to behind the goal . With a capacity of 12,000 Bournemouth look set to have the smallest ground in the Premier League . The club will have to install undersoil heating during the summer to adhere to Premier League rules, something which was not a requirement in the Championship. The press box, which at present separates home and away fans in the East Stand, will also move to the opposite side of the pitch to be closer to the dugouts. Stewards or netting would be put between supporters from either side to keep them apart during matches. Bournemouth only had the South Stand built when they won promotion to the Championship in 2013, such has been their rapid rise up the football pyramid.","Manager Eddie Howe does not like having away fans behind the goal .

Misty Machinshok, 33, has been jailed for 15 to 30 years for the abuse in which she 'coached' the pair on the best positions to conceive, and held her daughter's hand 'the first few times'. She planned to tell friends and family that the teenager got pregnant with a stranger at a house party in their home town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Her 29-year-old husband Gary Machinshok, who she met through a website called onlinebootycall.com, will be sentenced this month after pleading no contest to raping the child 'every few days' throughout 2013. Jailed: Misty Machinshok, 33, pleaded no contest to all charges for convincing her new husband to rape her 15-year-old daughter. The court heard it was a plot to have another child, as she is no longer fertile . He also admitted to sexually assaulting her 11-year-old sister but struck a plea deal which means he cannot be charged for it. Prosecutor Nancy Violi called the crime 'the most heinous' she had dealt with in 14 years on the job. The rape came to light when one of the girl's friends alerted a teacher who called police, Violi said. Both victims are now in foster care. Awaiting sentencing: Her husband Gary Machinshok, 29, whom she met on onlinebootycall.com, has admitted raping the girl 'every few days' in 2013, and sexually assaulting her 11-year-old sister . It is not clear why Mrs Machinshok is no longer able to have children. In January, she pleaded guilty to rape, aggravated assault, conspiracy, child endangerment and other counts. Defense attorney Mary Deady conceded that her client had made 'a lot of bad decisions,' but said she was pleading guilty to protect the child from having to testify. Mrs Machinshok' father, Bill Englert, also leaped to her defense to say her involvement in the rape was 'over-emphasized' by prosecutors, according to Inquisitr.","Misty Machinshok of Pennsylvania is no longer able to have children .

Andrew Steele, 40, has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease in the shooting deaths last August of his wife, 39-year-old Ashlee Steele, and her 38-year-old sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, of Lake Elmo, Minnesota. Taking the stand for the defense on Day 2 of the insanity phase of his trial  Dr. Doug Tucker testified that a rambling note Steele wrote about suicide and sexual relations with his wife and sister-in-law is delusional and shows Steele's brain was deteriorating because of ALS. Tucker said that was the reason Steele killed the two and that he was 'unable to conform his conduct to the law.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: On Day of his insanity trial, former Wisconsin sheriff's deputy Andrew Steele, 40, was wheeled into the courtroom to hear testimony from a forensic psychiatrist and his sister-in-law . Tragic sisters: This undated photo provided by Rachelle Putnam shows Ashlee Steele, left, and her sister, Kacee Tollefsbol, both were found dead of gunshot wounds at Steele's home in Fitchburg, Wisconsin . Steele, a former Dane County deputy, was diagnosed with the progressive neurodegenerative disease last June. The defendant claims he blacked out during the killings. And on Tuesday, the defense kicked things off detailing Steele's condition and how science will prove him not responsible. The prosecution disagrees. The State asked all witnesses if Steele had memory issues before that day in August, and they all said no. In a mostly incoherent, stream-of-consciousness letter written by Steele the day before the murders, the former deputy claimed he had had a sexual relationship with his sister-in-law and enjoyed 'numerous threesomes' with Kacee and his wife, reported the station WIBA. The typo-riddled note also stated that when Kacee and Ashlee learned of his ALS diagnosis, they proposed a suicide pact. According to Steele, the women wanted to jump off a cruise ship together, poison themselves with carbon monoxide inside a car, or shoot themselves with his service weapon. Video from WMTV . ALS: Andrew Steele, pictured in court in 2014, penned a rambling note a day before the killing claiming that he had had threesomes with his wife and sister-in-law, and that the three of them had made a suicide pact . Case: Steele argued last month that he was not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect to first-degree intentional homicide charges because he could not resist impulses . Tearful testimony: The slain sisters’ third sibling, Hailee Mesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol . 'See you all on the other side,' the note concluded. The missive was last edited on Steele’s phone just after 6am August 22. About seven hours later, a mortally wounded Kacee Tollefsbol called 911 saying she and her sisters had been shot,. Dr Tucker testified that there is no evidence to support Steele's claims that he had been in a three-way relationship with his wife and sister-in-law. Friends of Kacee Tollefsbol also said in court that her and Steele's relationship did not go beyond that of a brother and sister, reported Wisconsin State Journal. However, the slain sisters’ surviving sibling, HaileeMesiterling, said from the stand that Andrew Steele was in love with Tollefsbol and acted inappropriately towards her during a family vacation last summer. In her opening statement Tuesday, Jessa Nicholson, Steele’s defense attorney, said her client maintains that on the day of the killings he and Ashlee had sex involving bondage, and a zip tie accidentally fastened too tight around her neck, according to WKOW. Death: Sisters Ashlee Steele, left, and Kacee M. Tollefsbol, right, were shot dead leaving six children behind between them . In happier times: Ashlee Steele, left, had been working tirelessly to raise money to pay for her husband's treatment . Steele’s last memory from that day, according to his attorney, is of him trying to find a pair of scissors to cut the restraint around his wife’s neck. He then blacked out and awakened later in a hospital bed with a tube down his throat. Unable to speak, the 40-year-old wrote notes asking if he had been in a car accident and inquiring after his wife. The trial is expected to continue into next week. If the jury finds him responsible for the double-homicide, Steel could face up to a life sentence without parole. Ashlee Steele, 39, was found shot in the head in the master bedroom and cops found Andrew Steele sitting in a laundry room with a pistol. The former deputy had started the dryer and vented it back into the room and he had set up a grill loaded with hot charcoal in the room in a possible suicide attempt by carbon monoxide. Accused: Andrew Steele is wheeled out of his home in a stretcher Friday after allegedly murdering his wife and her sister . The killings came just days after the victims and the suspect's friends took part in the ALS ice bucket challenge, raising $23,000 towards the ailing deputy's medical expenses. In his letter, Steele lamented that collected funds were not enough to cover their family's expenses.  . Between the two of them, the slain sisters have left six children behind. As he addressed the court, Steele's speech sounded slurred as he waived his right to review the statements of potential jurors claiming to be unable to serve during his three-week trial. Around 15 jurors will be picked from 120 potential jurors for the trial which is scheduled to begin with jury selection on April 13. It will be a two-phase trial, the first to establish guilt, the second to decide whether he was legally responsible for his actions. The dramatic case saw Steele wheeled into the courtroom by bailiffs at the start of a status conference before Circuit Judge Nicholas McNamara. Challenge: His wife, Ashlee Steele spearheaded the effort to raise money for her husband dubbed 'Tough as Steele', posting videos of the ice bucket challenges on her Facebook account . Family: The couple, pictured, had two children, and had been together for 26 years . His lawyer, Jessa Nicholson, said that Steele can still walk and that his speech has been affected by his ALS, but that otherwise he was doing well. ALS does not affect the brains of most people who are diagnosed with the disease, but Nicholson said about 20 per cent experience dementia. Nicholson wrote that Steele has suffered damage to his hippocampus, the emotional center of the brain, causing poor impulse control and loss of memory. His frontal lobe was also damaged, which can cause loss of inhibition, personality changes and loss of the ability to conform his conduct to the law.","Andrew Steele, 40, claims that the terminal disease affected his brain .

But, nearly a quarter of a century ago, Paul Gascoigne was just a footballer. Not an ordinary footballer - he was a brilliantly talented maverick, but still a footballer. And 24 years ago today, he scored what was arguably the finest goal of his career. There are some who might say it was the finest goal ever scored at Wembley. The other main contender for that prize is probably another of his, for England against Scotland at Euro 96. Paul Gascoigne hits the 35-yard free-kick that would cement his place in Tottenham legend . The Spurs midfielder struck a ferocious shot that has gone down as one of the all-time great goals at Wembley . Gascoigne's goal came five minutes into an FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham's arch-rivals, Arsenal . Gunners goalkeeper David Seaman (right) got his hands to the ball but the power on Gascoigne's shot still beat him . But April 14, 1991 was FA Cup semi-final day. Tottenham Hotspur vs Arsenal. Fierce rivals battling it out for a place in the final when the oldest cup competition in football meant so much to every club that entered. Arsenal won the league that year. But had you asked their fans at Wembley that day whether they would rather win the title or the FA Cup having knocked out Spurs, and many would have opted for the latter. They didn't get the choice, however, and that was because of Gascoigne. It took him just five minutes to make the indelible mark. Tottenham won a free-kick 35 yards from goal. Nobody suspected much. Certainly not Barry Davies, who was commentating on the game for the BBC. Gascoigne runs towards the Spurs fans to celebrate as Vinny Samways (left) joins the wild scenes . The then England star leaps into the air to celebrate his glorious strike at the home of football . Gascoigne's goal set Spurs on their way to a 3-1 victory, and they would go on to beat Nottingham Forest in the final . 'Is Gascoigne going to have a crack?,' he asked. It was a relaxed, throwaway question. 'He is you know,' came the next line shortly after, excitement barely registering. Gascoigne took a run-up at the ball, and swung hard with his right boot. He nailed it, right on the sweet spot. The shot quickly became a cannonball, bursting through David Seaman's gloves and into the top corner of the net, despite the goalkeeper getting his hands to the ball. 'Oh I say!' screamed Davies, whose commentary would now go down in legend as well as the goal. 'Brilliant!' Spurs fans celebrated wildly in the stands. 'That...is... schoolboy's own stuff. Oh, I bet even he can't believe it. 'Is there anything left from this man to surprise us? That is one of the finest free-kicks this stadium has ever seen.' It was, and still is. 24 years from now it still will be. So let's forget for a moment about the Gazza we know today, and simply celebrate the genius of Paul Gascoigne.

The photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. Which is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. Haas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, ""Ernst Haas: On Set."" ""Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,"" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. And the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. The photographers ""are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,"" Jacob said. Such distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on. There's a striking picture of Orson Welles in 1949's ""The Third Man,"" hemmed in by the darkness in a way that suggests the shadowy themes of the classic film. Another, of Gregory Peck and Chuck Connors in 1958's ""The Big Country,"" is as dramatic as any full-scale movie duel. (Westerns were a specialty.) But Haas also has a way of documenting the artificiality of film work, whether it's capturing the sprawling, workaday set of 1965's ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" or snapping a relaxed picture of Barbara Streisand as Dolly Levi in 1969's ""Hello, Dolly!"" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. The former is particularly interesting: an image of actors splayed on crosses for the crucifixion scene, surrounded by ladders, a camera crane, a painted scrim and several casually dressed crew members. Jacob observes that in each of Haas' images there's an eye for the unusual. The black-and-white work from ""The Greatest Story Ever Told,"" for example, is almost prayerful, while the color images call attention to the artificiality of film. And some of Haas' other color images, especially his work for 1961's ""West Side Story,"" fit in neatly with others in his catalog, as Haas was known for an impressionistic blur of hues that Jacob calls ""the Haas effect."" Haas died in 1986, and despite being celebrated during his life, his name is somewhat forgotten these days. Jacob hopes that ""Ernst Haas: On Set"" reminds people just what a master he was. ""A lot of these are familiar images, but you don't necessarily associate them with Haas,"" he said. ""On the other hand, people who know Haas well don't actually know this work, because it was work for hire and wasn't ever put together in this way before."" Ernst Haas was an Austrian photographer who passed away in 1986. He was a member of Magnum Photos.","Ernst Haas, a celebrated 20th-century photographer, was a regular on movie sets .

6407,ba46dd0c125727c1cb5521c08ba7c526c28a512d,"A woman who weighs 400lbs has told how men are paying her around $1,500 (£1,000) a month to let them watch her devour fast food and sugary treats on camera. New Yorker Sarah Reign, 26, describes herself as a 'feedee', who gorges on junk food in various states of undress to titillate paying male viewers. After working shifts as a security guard at a factory, Miss Reign disrobes down to her underwear and switches on her webcam. Happy to be a 'feedee': Sarah Reign, from New York, supplements her day job as a security guard by gorging on camera for men who like to watch her eat . Miss Reign, who weighs 26 stone, says she enjoyed eating so much, she decided to turn it into a job . She says fans love to watch her enjoying food; she might gorge on a whole chocolate cake or cover her stomach with butter, acts that can earn her around $1,500 (£1,000) a month in addition to her regular pay. After realising that her weight could become a lucrative sideline for her, she set about gaining more and is now six stone heavier than before she started. She says: 'I really enjoy eating. No one at work knows my secret. It felt awkward eating on camera at first as fans love to watch you chewing every mouthful. 'But I eat so much anyway I thought it'd be fun to do it on cam. I just keep eating until I'm full.' Her new career has also led her to the world of 'squashing', where men pay her to sit on them when she meets them in person. She says of her first squashing experience: 'It was awkward but I got really into it.' Miss Reign says that she won't sit on anyone naked though, always keeping her underwear on. Sarah Reign says her fans love to watch her enjoying food . The men who watch Miss Reign's videos love to see the plus-size entertainer chowing down on junk food . 'I won't do nude squashing,' she vowed. 'I just wear a vest top and tiny shorts.' The security guard adds that she has always been large and that her weight has never been an issue for her. In fact, in 2008, aged 20 and weighing 20 stone, she celebrated her figure by posting glamour shots of herself online in skimpy clothing. How did this sideline come to pass? Miss Reign joined a site for bigger women who like to flaunt their shape, she soon had plenty of male attention. 'It's such an ego boost,' she admitted. 'So many of them wanted to see me eat on camera, I thought, 'Why not?' After a period of using web cams for feeders, she then set up her own video channel. 'It's sexy to be big,' she said. 'I really enjoy eating on camera so I started gaining weight on purpose. 'I've put on six stone since I started. 'Lots of men want to feed me so much I can't move anymore, but that's not my thing. I still want to be active and do my day job.' The security guard admits she's a 'clean freak' and puts underwear covered in food straight into the washing machine when the camera is turned off . Squashing: Miss Reign now offers a service for men who enjoy being smothered by a larger lady . Her lingerie drawer is overflowing with different outfits  but the most common request is for Miss Reign to dress up as a pig. 'I have a piggy nose and ears that I wear and eat really messily in, covering my face with chocolate. 'But when the camera's off, I'm a clean freak and put my bra and the towels I use to cover the floor straight in the washing machine. 'Sometimes I take the camera into the shower and film myself getting clean, that's really sexy.' Although she had plenty of requests for squashing sessions, she did not take the plunge until three years ago. 'I had so many men ask, but there was a guy who lived nearby who wanted to try it,' Miss Reign said. 'The first time, I watched some videos the night before to prepare but nothing phases me. 'When I got to the hotel it was weird at first and it's hard not to laugh. 'He lay down on the bed and I climbed on top of him. But I got into it really quickly. 'For the hour session, I was crushing him the whole time.' Cashing in: With a lowly paid job in New York as a security guard, Miss Reign can boost her income by $1,500 (£1,000) a month . Miss Reign has had eight squashing clients and some of them will not admit they love big women. 'A lot of them are in the fat closet,' she joked. 'They say how thin their girlfriends are and they're obviously worried they'll be the butt of their friends' jokes if they admit they love fat girls. 'But there's also men who want women to do stuff like this but most girls won't believe them that they think fat is sexy. 'They're self-conscious and want to look slimmer, not embrace their shape.' One of her other sidelines is posting out her lacy pants after they've been worn. She has had long-term boyfriends since she started being a part-time squasher. 'It's not been an issue for them. Some of them have watched the videos, some of them haven't,' she said. 'Most of them have really supported me and didn't care. 'I'm single right now, but I wouldn't rule out going on a date with an online fan. 'I have men ask all the time, it's more that it's not practical and they're in other countries. I have lots of fans in the UK and Germany.'

7038,561dae20bc4529ab2b86206ce478d6a5747b6333,"(CNN)A 110-day cat-and-mouse chase spanning from Antarctic waters to the coast of west Africa had an unlikely end when the crew of an alleged poaching vessel were rescued by conservationists pursuing them. Environmentalist group Sea Shepherd had been tailing the Thunder -- subject of an Interpol ""purple notice"" for suspected fraud and fisheries-related crimes -- since its ship the Bob Barker encountered it in the Southern Ocean several months ago. The pursuit ended early Monday in the Gulf of Guinea, off the coast of west Africa, when the Bob Barker received a distress call from the Thunder. ""We were literally a few hundred meters away; they said the ship was sinking and they were abandoning the Thunder,"" said Sea Shepherd spokesman Adam Burling. ""We invited the crew -- 40 of them -- on board, had a medical officer check them over, provided them with food and water."" Bob Barker Captain Peter Hammarstedt said the crew rescued from the ship had been handed over to the Sao Tome coastguard early Tuesday. He said he hoped the authorities would work with Interpol to prosecute those operating the vessel. ""We obviously want to see the captain of the Thunder prosecuted for his offenses,"" he told CNN by phone from the Bob Barker, at sea to the west of Sao Tome. Hammarstedt said he believed the Thunder was deliberately sunk to destroy physical evidence of illegal fishing. ""I'm 100% confident that the captain of the Thunder destroyed his own ship,"" he said. Hammarstedt said he had managed to send three crew members aboard the abandoned Thunder before it went down. ""Usually what happens when a vessel is sinking is the master will ensure all compartments and hatches are shut so as to maintain buoyancy,"" he said. ""On the Thunder, all the hatches had been opened, including the hatch leading to the fish hold."" He said his crew had retrieved computers, mobile phones and other devices from the Thunder that would be handed over to assist any investigation. They had also retrieved a fish from the ship's fish hold, which he said was about a quarter full. He said the fish was a toothfish, the prized stock his organization claims the Thunder was illegally catching when they were encountered in the Southern Ocean. More surprising was the reaction of the captain of the Thunder as his ship went under, he claimed. ""When the vessel went completely under the water, the captain of the Thunder, who was in a life raft at the time, started cheering and applauding, which was very unusual behavior for a skipper who had just lost his ship,"" he said. The pursuit of the Thunder began after the Bob Barker encountered the vessel off the coast of Antarctica, said Burling. He claimed the vessel was found with its nets in the water, illegally catching Patagonian toothfish. The Thunder dropped its nets and left the scene; a second Sea Shepherd vessel that was brought in to retrieve the net found about $3 million of toothfish catch in about 72km of illegal gillnet, he claimed. ""That's why they're out there in these shadowlands, these unpatrolled remote regions,"" he said. Meanwhile the Bob Barker, supported by a second Sea Shepherd vessel, pursued the Thunder all the way to the Gulf of Guinea. During that time, Burling claimed, the Bob Barker narrowly avoided being rammed by the fishing vessel, while its smaller boats were struck with grappling hooks. The rescue had gone smoothly despite the months of tensions between the two vessels, said Burling. ""We worried what they might be like to our crew, whether they might be hostile or violent to us,"" he said. But the Indonesian crew who made up the majority of those on board the Thunder seemed ""very relieved"" to be rescued. The officers -- who he believed were Spanish -- were less so. ""Perhaps they would have preferred to have been rescued by someone else, but given the location there was really no other option,"" he said. An Interpol ""purple notice,"" released at the request of New Zealand in December 2013, put out a global call for information on the Thunder, as well as information on ""the individuals and networks that own, operate and profit from the illegal actions of the vessel."" It said the vessel had changed its name, national registration and other characteristics a number of times to avoid detection of its illegal fishing activities, and had sailed under the names ""Wuhan N 4"" and ""Kuko,"" and under the flags of Nigeria and Mongolia. The Interpol notice said it had ""conflicting information"" about the identity of the vessel's current operator, but said it had previously been registered as owned by companies in Spain, the Seychelles and Nigeria. Interpol confirmed Tuesday that the purple notice remained in place. It said it had monitored the situation and noted that all the vessel's crew members were safely ashore. ""Interpol does not conduct investigations itself; however, we remain available to support any national law enforcement authorities with jurisdiction in this case if such assistance is requested,"" it told CNN. It said no requests had been received as yet.","Sea Shepherd rescues the crew of an alleged poaching ship it had chased for 110 days .

Karen Buckley, 24, disappeared from the Glasgow club in the early hours of Sunday morning without collecting her coat after telling friends she was going to the loo. CCTV cameras filmed her talking to a man outside the club before getting into his car and travelling to his flat in nearby Kelvindale . But fears over the Irish student’s safety were heightened yesterday after police revealed they had tracked down the man and he is not being treated as a suspect. Scroll down for video . Karen Buckley, 24, (left) pictured with friends on the night she went missing after leaving a Glasgow nightclub . Karen Buckley, a student at Glasgow Caledonia University,  has been missing since Sunday after going out with friends . Miss Buckley, who is brunette and 5ft 2in, was wearing a black jumpsuit and red heels when she was last seen leaving the man’s flat in Kelvindale at around 4am. A handbag thought to belong to her was found in a park near the man’s home yesterday, causing police to say they are ‘gravely concerned’ about her safety. The family of Miss Buckley, who is from Cork in the Republic of Ireland, have flown to Scotland to help with the search for the Glasgow Caldeonian University student, who studies occupational therapy. Her mother Marion told a press conference in Glasgow: 'We just want Karen home safely, we are desperate. She is our only daughter, we love her dearly. Miss Buckley, who is originally from Cork in Ireland was last seen when she left the flat of a man she had met at around 4am on Sunday morning and was planning to walk home to her flat in Hill Street in the Garnethill area . Miss Buckley's parents Marian and John have travelled to Glasgow from Cork to help in the search for their daughter . 'If anybody has any information please come forward, we would dearly appreciate it.' Her father John Buckley, 62, added: 'We are extremely concerned for her. We are desperate to get her back and safe with her family - she is our only daughter, we love her dearly and just want her to come home safe and sound. 'She always keeps in contact with her family and friends to let them know where she is and what she is up to. 'To not return to her flat or be in contact with her pals - not responding to texts and calls to her mobile is very, very worrying as it is so out of character.' Miss Buckley arrived at the Sanctuary club with friends at around 11.45pm on Saturday and at around 1am she told them she was going to the toilet. She failed to return and did not take her jacket. She was then seen outside on CCTV talking to a man and then walking west along Dumbarton Road towards Church Street. Friends then raised the alarm on Sunday, saying it was 'very out of character' for her not to return home. Officers have traced the man Ms Buckley was seen speaking to outside the nightclub, and he is 'helping police with inquiries.' A map showing the last known movements of Miss Buckley around Glasgow on the night that she went missing . A handbag which police believe belongs to Miss Buckley was found in Dawsholm Park, near Dorchester Avenue, early this afternoon. There has been no activity on her social media accounts in the last couple of days and her mobile phone is believed to be out of battery. Detective Superintendent Jim Kerr, from Police Scotland's major investigations teams, stressed that the male was 'not a suspect.' He told the press conference: We've traced the man she was with in Dorchester Avenue. He believes he was intimate with her at his flat consensually in the early hours of Sunday. 'From what we can see, she does not appear to be under duress, there's no signs of a struggle or reluctance on her part to leave the club. 'However, that does not mean that something untoward has happened to her at a later stage. 'There was talk of another man she had been seen with. We've also traced him, we've spoken to him.' Police comb through trees in Kelvingrove Park below the tower of Glasgow University in the search for Miss Buckley . Police say there has been no activity on Miss Buckley's social media accounts and say that they have recovered her handbag . Miss Buckley, who has three older brothers, is described as white and around five to five foot two inches tall with brown eyes and dark hair which had long black curly extensions in it. When last seen, she was wearing a black jumpsuit with red high-heeled shoes and was carrying a black handbag. She also speaks with an Irish accent. Miss Buckley lives with three other student friends and earlier on Saturday evening had drinks with them in their flat before going to the night club, although her friends told police she was not drunk. Mr Kerr appealed for people to come forward with any information about the missing woman's whereabouts, saying while it 'may seem insignificant to them, however to us it may be the piece of information that leads us to finding her.'

'However, at this time we need the information about her whereabouts and her movements after leaving the club.' DS Kerr also appealed for information on a grey car that had been seen parked on remote roads between Milngavie and Drymen on Monday. He added: 'From our inquiries we are also keen to trace a grey car which was seen on the country roads between Milngavie and Drymen, between 11am and 3pm on Monday. 'The activity of this grey car on the Monday is something that we're a wee bit concerned about. This car has been seen at various locations on these roads and I want to know why.' 'We are gravely concerned that Karen has come to some harm, whether that is down to foul play, criminality or she has taken unwell or had an accident is obviously still to be established.'

3107,0c1248ebdaddd02d9df8d7e1c8aa4e1ada8be1de,"There is a rich and mildly amusing irony about Arsenal fans calling Chelsea boring for defending well, when these Gooners still celebrate a side that ground out results just to preserve their unbeaten record in 2003-04. They drew four of their last seven, the lifeless goalless stalemate at home to Birmingham a particular highlight. Instead of giving a shallow critique fuelled by sour grapes on Chelsea's title winners, maybe those fans should focus on the shortcomings of their own players, and in particular Mesut Ozil. Mesut Ozil has been sublime in recent weeks but he didn't do enough against Chelsea on Sunday . The German, celebrating the FA Cup win over Reading, needs to start performing to live up to his £42m tag . I've enjoyed some of Ozil's recent performances, he's been sublime more than spectacular, but he's definitely been a joy to watch. And so as I sat down to watch Arsenal face Chelsea, I felt confident that Ozil could be the difference between the two teams. I also felt that Arsenal could win the game, and win it well. And that if they did win it well, it would put huge pressure on Chelsea in the run-in. I felt there would be a chance that a big result for Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday might just open the title door for the Gunners. But it wasn't to be. And come the big moment, the big player fluffed his lines. Ozil wasn't terrible but he didn't impact the game enough. While Cesc Fabregas was sending a killer pass only for Oscar to be wiped out by the goalkeeper (how is that not a penalty?), and Willian carved Arsenal up with the pass of the match to gift a great chance to Ramires,  Ozil was tidy, nothing more. Cesc Fabregas outshone Ozil on Sunday as Chelsea showed why they are ahead of Arsenal this season . Fabregas, who left the Emirates pitch with Ozil's shirt, would have been better than the German for Arsenal . Ozil takes on Cesar Azpilicueta in a game where he was fine, but not good enough to change the result . He didn't stand out. He didn't impact the game enough to affect the result. He didn't show any signs of being world class, or worth £42million. And then when he had the chance to be the match winner, Ozil completely missed his kick with the goal gaping right in front of him. Poor technique. In the second half Chelsea played into Ozil's hands. They effectively gave him the ball and asked him what he could do. If he's as good as he's purported to be, he kills off Chelsea with his ability on the ball. But he couldn't create the winning goal. For all of Arsenal's pivotal, meaningful, must-win games in the last two seasons, Ozil has looked average. Even in the FA Cup final last year it was Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey who stood out, while Ozil failed to shine, complaining afterwards he was tired after his first season in English football. He was the most expensive player on the pitch on Sunday and come the end of his Arsenal career he will be judged on his impact. Ozil could go down the same route as Juan Sebastian Veron (left) and Andriy Shevchenko . When Thierry Henry says Arsenal need a new spine of their team, it's time to start listening . A player with a huge reputation signed for such a huge amount has to be more than just sublime. He has to have a major impact in the big games, he has to take the team to another level. Two seasons have gone and Ozil has failed to do that at Arsenal. There are other big signings with big reputations who have flopped in the Premier League – Andriy Shevchenko, Fernando Torres, Juan Sebastian Veron, and we're still waiting for the biggest of them all – Angel di Maria - to show us what he can do. Ozil could be joining that list unless he delivers something amazing next season. When an Arsenal legend like Thierry Henry points out that after all this time Arsene Wenger has constructed a team without a spine – Henry said they need a goalkeeper, a centre half, a defensive midfielder, and a top striker – you have to listen. He's right of course, but the knock-on effect is that the top players Arsenal have in their team need to deliver something extra special. And Ozil has failed to do that. In one of the biggest games of Arsenal's season, Ozil missed his kick when a late opportunity came his way . Arsenal fans are defensive of the Germany midfielder but that is merely a sign of their low expectations . Henry said what all Arsenal fans know, but most refuse to admit – Fabregas would have had a bigger impact in that team this season than Ozil has. There's a lot of goodwill from Arsenal fans towards  Ozil – they want him to be the hero, they want him to be their superstar. And that desperation means some have over-praised his performances. They're hoping it's some kind of twisted self-fulfilling prophecy – if they keep saying Ozil is brilliant, then maybe he will be. Witness this tweet about Ozil from Arsenal fan @girlgooner two weeks ago: 'I still can't believe he plays for my team Arsenal, I think we are very lucky, he's a very special player.' It seems you only have to sign for Arsenal these days to be a legend. That's how well Wenger has managed and manipulated standards and expectations at this once great football club. As for Ozil, he's been good. But he needs to be brilliant.","Mesut Ozil failed to deliver against Chelsea despite a perfect opportunity .

Dan, named for the character in Forest Gump who lost his legs, was the only one missing a paw and Sapphyre Johnson had to have her feet amputated . On Monday, the nine-week-old puppy Lt. Dan without a paw found a new home with Sapphyre Johnson, a toddler who lost both of her feet . Just like me!: Sapphyre and Lt. Dan made fast friends on Monday and the two will grow up together at Sapphyre's family's home in Tennesee . Greenville Online reports that the puppy was named after a character in the film Forest Gump who lost both of his legs. Fellow breeders suggested to Riddle when Lt. Dan was born that he should be put down because he might be too sick to live. But Riddle didn't buy it. When the hound grew a little, Riddle was determined to find a home for him with someone with special needs. Because her father was a Shriner she called Shriners Hospital to see if there was a special needs child or wounded veteran who might want a pet in their home. Sapphyre, who is from Tennessee, has been in the hospital ever since she was just three-months-old. 'When I was seven months pregnant, they did an ultra sound and told us she may be missing some fingers and toes,' said Sapphyre’s mother, Ashley Johnson. 'They don't know what caused it,' she said. Different: Lt.Dan was the only one out of nine puppies who was born without a paw and fellow breeders suggested to his original owner that he be put down . Brilliant Idea: Rather than kill Lt. Dan because he was different, his original owner Karen Riddle suggested that he be placed in a home with a wounded veteran or special needs child . Playing and learning: 'In the future, I could see Sapphyre at her first show-and-tell in school and she could bring in her dog and explain about her dog and herself,' said an employee at Shriners Hospital . Shriners gives prosthetics and orthopedic services to children under 18 no matter what their family's income is. 'She had just two really long toes on each foot. And when she was 1, we had them amputated so she could be fitted for prosthetics,' said Sapphyre's mother. Shriners even suggested prosthetic leg could be made for Lt.Dan when he grows large enough. When Sapphyre saw a picture of her new puppy she knew that she had to have him and she felt an instant connection. 'The first time I showed her a picture of the dog, she looked at it for a moment, and she said, ""That's my puppy. He's just like me,"" ' said Elaine Hardin who works at Shriners. Best friends: Sapphyre and Lt. Dan only just met but from the looks of it they are already best friends . 'He's a special dog and he's going to a special child.' Hardin told Greenville Online that the dog will help Sapphyre make friends and will also help her to explain her disability to other kids. 'In the future, I could see Sapphyre at her first show-and-tell in school and she could bring in her dog and explain about her dog and herself,' Hardin said. 'Everybody loves dogs and they'll want to know about her dog that's special like her.' On Monday Saphyyre was so happy to have her new puppy. 'Lt. Dan, Lt. Dan,' she called out to her new furry friend. The puppy felt so at home with his new owners that it fell asleep in the car as Sapphyre made her way home to Tennessee with her family.

The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain. He said the two parties were pretending to 'slug it out' ahead of next month's poll – but insisted they were both working to ramp up spending regardless of the deficit. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain . Mr Cameron said Ed Miliband could now only become Prime Minister with the support of the SNP. He told activists: 'We meet here in Scotland in the middle of a massive political fight. We've got Labour and the SNP on opposite sides – slugging it out – but if you take a step back they're really on the same side. 'You have a weak Labour party, who want more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. And the people who will prop them up, the SNP – who want even more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes.' Mr Cameron said together, the SNP and Labour 'pose a clear threat to the future of our United Kingdom', adding: 'A coalition of chaos.' He said: The SNP acting as the chain to Labour's wrecking ball, running right through our economic recovery - and it will be you who pays the price. With jobs losses, massive tax rises and an economy back on brink of bankruptcy.' Mr Cameron's blistering attack comes ahead of tonight's live TV election debates between the main 'challenger' parties - including Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon, alongside the leaders of Ukip, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Mr Cameron walks with the leader of Scottish Conservatives as they launch the Tories' election manifesto today . David Cameron and Nick Clegg are not taking part because they have been in power for the last five years. Mr Miliband is expected to use the BBC debate to issue a warning to Scottish voters that success for the SNP north of the border could deliver a Conservative government in Westminster. The Labour leader has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP in a hung Parliament, but he is likely to face calls from Ms Sturgeon to join a 'progressive alliance' to bring an immediate end to austerity, which is also backed by Plaid and the Greens. Nicola Sturgeon has called on Ed Miliband to work with the SNP to 'lock out' David Cameron from Number 10 . Conservatives are hoping that the debate would give added bite to their claim that a Miliband administration would be 'in the pocket' of the SNP. Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: 'Will we see the alternative to David Cameron in the Challengers Debate? A Frankenstein coalition to bankrupt and break up Britain.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate.","The PM said the SNP and Labour presented a 'clear and present danger'

10178,00bfcb9d07faa098e1f725594e884d0e221dc489,"Visitors to a wildlife park in New Zealand got to encounter a pride of lions up-close and personal. Filmed at the Orana Wildlife Park – the country’s only open-range zoo – the video shows the lions interacting with the visitors who stand inside a metal cage attached to a car. The video, which was captured by Ekant Veer, 35, an associate professor at the University of Canterbury, also shows the lions scaling the cage and eating meat through its bars. The lions at Orana Wildlife Park approach the metal cage and begin interacting with the people inside . Standing with its paws against the cage, a lion is introduced as Sakura who is around 11-years-old and weighs about 265kg. As the keeper speaks, the lion licks at a piece of meat that is held up against the bars as another lion walks across the roof of the cage. Looking down at the people below, the lion wanders around as if deciding who it would like to make its prey before staring down the lens of the camera. Set tongues wagging! One of the lions notices meat and begins sticking out its tongue in the hope of being fed . A lion stands next to one of the keepers and its large paw is the same size as the lady's head . The people inside can be seen recording the many lions from their phones, while another – with paws the same size as the keeper’s head – holds itself up against the cage and chews on some meat. Later in the video people can be seen pointing out the various felines as a keeper moves her hand along the cage, instigating the lion to follow. Still frames capture a lion standing up against the side of the cage alongside the keeper – its power and size is plain to see. A keeper holds a piece of meat up to the bars of the cage and a lion follows her hand in the hope of receiving it . A number of lions are fed directly through the metal bars, while others receive meat dropped from the back of the cage . The car then begins driving away and the lions can be seen chasing after the people in the hope of receiving more food. A keeper then drops meat from the back of it and the lions begin tailing off one by one with their own little piece of food. The video concludes with one lion picking up a final lump of meat from the floor and being chased by another, angry feline. A lion scales the cage and looks down at the people below as if deciding which one it would like to eat . The people inside can be seen pointing and filming the lion who wanders along the top of the cage above them . Orana Wildlife Park was opened in 1976 and is owned and operated by registered charity, Orana Wildlife Trust. Located on the outskirts of Christchurch, the wildlife park is unique in that the people are caged in order to view the animals, not the other way around.","Video shows the lions scaling the cage to look at the people inside .

5023,11b3565b7bd3e53c7740ebf580758d58af7891c6,"New York (CNN)A suburban New York cardiologist has been charged in connection with a failed scheme to have another physician hurt or killed, according to prosecutors. Dr. Anthony Moschetto, 54, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to criminal solicitation, conspiracy, burglary, arson, criminal prescription sale and weapons charges in connection to what prosecutors called a plot to take out a rival doctor on Long Island. He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. Requests for comment from attorneys representing Moschetto and Chmela were not returned.  It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Moschetto's attorney, Randy Zelin, said Wednesday that his client ""will be defending himself vigorously,"" the New York Post reported. ""Doctors are supposed to ensure the health and wellbeing of people, but Dr. Moschetto is alleged to have replaced that responsibility with brazen, callous and criminal acts,"" Acting Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas said in a statement. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to ""blow up a building."" He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. ""The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute,"" according to the statement from the district attorney's office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. ""He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed,"" said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, reported CNN affiliate WCBS.

Robert Penny told the Herald Sun that he was shocked when police charged him with murdering Claire Acocks and his wife Margaret Penny at Old London Coiffure Hairdressers in Portland on May 3, 1991, about 350km west of Melbourne. The 83-year-old, of Malvern East, has spoken out since he briefly appeared at Melbourne Magistrates court on Monday. Margaret Penny was murdered in a hair salon in Portland, Victoria on May 3, 1991 .

Not knowing anything about it, really, and to be charged with a double murder - what the hell would I want to murder someone for?' Mr Penny told the Herald Sun. 'They had some new faces in the police force that were investigating and they suddenly decided it was my problem... It's just bizarre.' Mr Penny also revealed that he called his late-wife's sister, Ann Bryden, to further plead his innocence a day after facing court. 'He rang and said, ""I didn't do it, why would I kill her?

9696,c158d6aadb8ed55ba3b718733eeb21dd86f44af2,"Ed Miliband has been accused of stooping to a 'shameful' new low by blaming David Cameron for the Mediterranean refugee crisis. The Labour leader  used a keynote campaign speech today to suggest the deaths of hundreds of refugees fleeing North Africa could have been avoided if the Prime Minister had done more following his intervention in Libya to remove the former dictator Colonel Gaddafi. In a briefing note sent out before the speech, Labour went further - claiming the crisis was 'in part a direct result' of Mr Cameron's foreign policy. The allegation provoked a furious response from the Tories who this morning demanded that Mr Miliband apologise for the 'outrageous and disgraceful' remarks. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband, speaking at Chatham House in central London this morning, has been accused of stooping to a 'shameful' new low by blaming David Cameron for the Mediterranean refugee crisis . David Cameron and the former foreign secretary William Hague, speaking in Lincoln today, were accused of neglecting Libya after helping to topple Colonel Gaddafi . It comes after Mr Cameron held emergency talks with EU leaders in Brussels yesterday over how to tackle the growing humanitarian crisis. The Prime Minister announced the deployment of one of Britain's biggest warships - HMS Bulwark - as part of beefed-up efforts to prevent more refugees packing onto tiny boats. Up to 1,750 refugees have lost their lives trying to reach Europe this year - out of around 35,000 who have tried to make the crossing. The vast majority of the migrant boats set off from the Libya, which has descended into chaos in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution which saw Colonel Gaddafi swept from power with the support of France and Britain. Over 200 illegal migrants were  rescued by Italian Guardia di Finanza boat 'Denaro' in the Mediterranean Sea this week . The refugees will be shipped to the Italian mainland after being rescued by Italian coast guards . Mr Miliband today accused the Prime Minister of taking his eye off the ball by failing to secure a stable transfer of power in the wake of the uprising. The Labour leader said this failure had contributed to the crisis today. But the suggestion sparked a furious response from the Prime Minister today. Mr Cameron said: 'Let me be clear about what Ed Miliband has said. I have learned as Prime Minister that it is so important in a dangerous and uncertain world that you show clarity, consistency and strength on these foreign policy issues. 'People will look at these ill-judged remarks and they will reach their own conclusions.' Former foreign secretary William Hague slammed the 'ill-judged, opportunistic remarks'. He said: 'Foreign policy is not something that you can just discover 13 days before polling day. 'This is the first time in five years that Ed Miliband has troubled himself to make a full length speech on foreign policy.' Environment Secretary Liz Truss said Mr Miliband should withdraw the 'outrageous and disgraceful' remarks. 'Accusing the Prime Minister of causing these deaths - whether directly or indirectly - I think is wrong,' she told BBC Radio 4's Today. 'Ed Miliband feels like he's losing the argument and he's lashing out. Of course we should be talking about foreign affairs but it has to be done in a proper manner.' Seek and destroy: Britain will send one of its biggest warships, HMS Bulwark (above), to the Mediterranean within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers . David Cameron held high-level talks with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (left), German Chancellor Angela Merkel (top left) and French President Francois Hollande (top right) at a European Union summit yesterday . A senior Tory source added: 'This takes Labour's relentless negative campaigning to a new low.' The source pointed out that Mr Miliband had supported the intervention in Libya which he now blamed for causing the crisis. Nick Clegg said the Labour attack was a 'distasteful' attempt to make political capital from the Mediterranean refugee crisis. Mr Clegg insisted that 'a considerable amount of thought went in by the international community' to the aftermath and 'a huge amount of help and assistance and money has gone into trying to do our bit from outside'. He acknowledged that it was 'legitimate to say that things then spiral in directions that you can't fully predict'. 'All I would plead for is a little less finger-pointing wisdom from Ed Miliband - when he supported the intervention in the first place - and a little bit more adherence to facts about exactly who is ending up on these boats, why they are and what we can now do about it to stop this terrible tragedy,' he said. Mr Cameron was given a rapturous reception in Tripoli in September 2011 after flying into the capital following the Nato bombing campaign which allowed rebels to overthrow Colonel Gaddafi . Libyan rebels overthrew the country's dictator Colonel Gaddafi (right) with the support of British, French and US airstrikes . But the shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander defended Mr Miliband's attack – and insisted the Prime Minister had failed to plan for the aftermath of Colonel Gaddafi's downfall. He said: 'It is a failure of post-conflict planning for which the international community bears responsibility. That's not a matter of dispute, it's a matter of fact.' In his speech to the Chatham House think tank today, Mr Miliband said: 'The tragedy is that this could have been anticipated. 'Since the action, the failure of post-conflict planning has become obvious. David Cameron was wrong to assume that Libya's political culture and institutions could be left to evolve and transform on their own. 'It should have been avoided. And Britain could have played its part in ensuring the international community stood by the people of Libya in practice rather than standing behind the unfounded hopes of potential progress only in principle.' In March 2011 Labour and Tory MPs united to back military action against Libya to stop Muammar Gaddafi committing a ‘bloody massacre’. The country’s then dictator had threatened to slaughter his own people to cling on to power after a rebel uprising in the east of the country. The Commons vote came after the UN Security Council passed a motion giving Britain, France and the US the authority to use ‘all necessary measures’ to protect Libyan civilians. Labour leader Ed Miliband said he supported the action, arguing it was ""a just cause, with a feasible mission, and it has international support"". Less than six months later, in November 2011, after Western bombing raids allowed Libya’s rebel forces to sweep the Gaddafi regime from power, Mr Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy flew into Tripoli. It was the first visit by Western leaders since the dictator 42-year-rule had come to an end. Mr Cameron praised the Libyan fighters as ‘lions’ and described their revolt as the moment ‘when the Arab Spring could become an Arab Summer’ in which ‘we see democracy advance in other countries too’. But in the three years since Colonel Gaddafi was toppled, the country has descended into chaos. There has been no effective government since the 2011 uprising. Instead, there are hundreds of different armed groups fighting for territory and influence. It currently has two rival governments, one based in the capital, Tripoli, and the other based hundreds of miles away in the port of Tobruk. People smugglers are taking advantage of the subsequent chaos and confusion tearing the country apart to ply their trade with little to no threat of being caught. With ISIS also having established strongholds in the towns on Sirte and Derna, and with smaller bases elsewhere in the country, fear of capture and execution at the hands of the radical Islamists is driving the desperate migrants to leave Libya as quickly as they can, dangerously overloading vessels.","Tories accuse Ed Miliband  of stooping to a 'shameful' new low in campaign .

Producing beef, for example, requires large amounts of water, land for grazing and emits tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. But now Bill Gates, the billionaire founder of Microsoft and philanthropist, has said it may in fact be possible to keep eating meat and still care for the planet. Scroll down for video . Bill Gates, a failed vegetarian, says the world's demand for meat can be met with 'moderation and innovation' In his most recent blog post, the world's richest man, has defended meat eating, saying was unrealistic to expect large numbers of people to become vegetarian. He also explains that some of the impacts of meat farming have been overstated. Instead he believes it will be possible to provide enough meat for the world's growing population as demand in developing countries increases. Scientists have already cooked up the first test tube beef burger, but now researchers in Israel are working on the world's first lab-grown chicken. Professor Amit Gefen, a bioengineer at Tel Aviv University, . has begun a year-long feasibility study into manufacturing . chicken in a lab, funded by a non-profit group called the Modern . Agriculture Foundation which hopes 'cultured meat' will one day . replace the raising of animals for slaughter. The foundation's co-founder Shir Friedman hopes to have . produced 'a recipe for how to culture chicken cells' by the end . of the year. The researchers say their task is more difficult than . producing the first lab-grown hamburger, a $300,000 beef patty . cooked up at Maastricht University in the Netherlands after five . years of research financed by Google co-founder Sergey . Brin. To make the beef burger muscle fibers were grown in the lab from stem cells taken from a cow. These tiny chunks were then combined to make the beef burger. Those who tasted it said it was like meat, but not 'juicy'. Professor Gefen, however, is hoping to make a whole piece of . chicken, starting from a single cell. He said: 'Although it might be possible to get people in richer countries to eat less or shift toward less-intensive meats like chicken, I don't think it's realistic to expect large numbers of people to make drastic reductions. 'Evolution turned us into omnivores. 'But there are reasons to be optimistic. For one thing, the world's appetite for meat may eventually level off. 'Consumption has plateaued and even declined a bit in many rich countries, including France, Germany, and the United States. 'I also believe that innovation will improve our ability to produce meat.' The consumption of meat has met with considerable criticism in recent years as climate change experts have warned about the harm it is doing to the planet. A recent report from Chatham House said that the global livestock industry produces more greenhouse gas emissions than cars, planes, trains and ships combined. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also found that dietary change was also necessary to 'substantially lower' emissions. Lord Stern, the economist appointed by the British government to assess the financial impacts of climate change, has also urged people to give up meat. However, calls for widespread vegetarianism have been deeply unpopular with the general public. Some researchers have also estimated that it takes several thousand litres of water to produce just one kilogram of beef due to the water needed to grow feed for them. Cattle, like those above, and other livestock produce more greenhouse gas globally than transport emissions . Bill Gates has invested some of his fortune into projects aimed at finding sustainable solutions to problems in poverty stricken areas of the world including turning sewage water into clean drinking water (shown above) This makes livestock farming increasingly difficult in areas hit by drought. Cattle grazing can also take valuable land that could be used to grow more affordable agricultural crops. Demand for meat is expected to soar over the next 30 years or so, with global beef consumption rising from 64 million tonnes in 2005 to 106 million tonnes in 2050 according to the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations. It also says pork demand will rise from 100 million tonnes to 143 million tonnes and chicken consumption will increase from 82 million tonnes to 181 million tonnes. However, Mr Gates, who set up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with his wife to fund research into sustainable technology that can tackle poverty around the world, said some of the impacts of meat have been overstated. He points to research that suggests most of the water needed for livestock production is known as green-water, which is used to grow grass. Global demand for beef, like the steak above, is expected to soar to 181 million tonnes by 2050 but Mr Gates says that it should be possible to meet this as some of the environmental impacts of meat are overstated . Most of this green water comes from rainfall and also evaporates back into the atmosphere, meaning it is not lost. He said: 'One study that excluded green water found that it takes just 44 litres – not thousands – to produce a kilo of beef.' Mr Gates has also been funding new research projects aimed at producing meat substitutes and says he has been impressed with the results. Companies like Beyond Meat and Hampton Creek Foods have been experimenting with turning plant proteins into foods that taste and look like meat and eggs. Mr Gates also explains that he once dabbled with being vegetarian himself in his late twenties but found he couldn't keep it going. He argues that meat is an important source of nutrition needed to help children develop healthy and said it was important that people in developing countries have access to these foods. He said: 'With a little moderation and more innovation, I do believe the world can meet its need for meat.'","Billionaire Microsoft founder has defended meat eating in his latest blog .

Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring . The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend . It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring . Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat . In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

A convicted murderer who murdered and dismembered his teenage victim has had boiling hot water thrown over him in an apparent revenge attack in a Scottish prison. William Beggs, 54, known as the Limbs in the Loch murderer, was described by police at the time of his conviction in 2001 as a 'serial killer in the making'. Beggs is serving a life sentence in Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, for raping, murdering and dismembering Barry Wallace, 18, in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in 1999. The teenager's limbs and torso were found in Loch Lomond and his head was dumped in the sea off the Ayrshire coast. Beggs screamed in pain as boiling water was thrown over his face and hands in the cell attack, the Scottish Daily Record reported yesterday. The alleged attacker was due for release this year and has since been moved to Shotts Prison. He reportedly told friends he was taking revenge after Beggs attacked him soon after he arrived at the prison. It is understood Beggs was treated for burns in the prison's infirmary but did not need to attend hospital. The teenager's limbs and torso were found in Loch Lomond (pictured) and his head was dumped in the sea . Supermarket worker Mr Wallace vanished on December 5 1999, after a Christmas night out with colleagues in his home town of Kilmarnock. In 2001 a jury found Beggs took the teenager to his flat and subjected him to a serious sexual assault. Beggs is serving a life sentence for murdering and dismembering shop worker Barry Wallace (pictured) He then murdered him and cut up his body. Shortly after the crime, Beggs, originally from Northern Ireland, fled to the Netherlands. After lengthy extradition proceedings, he was ordered in January 2001 to be returned to Scotland to face trial. After the High Court jury delivered their majority verdict and found him guilty it was revealed Beggs was once cleared of a similar murder by appeal court judges on a technicality. Beggs was jailed in 1987 at Teeside Crown Court for murdering a barman he met in a gay nightclub by slashing his throat, only to have the conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal, the BBC reported at the time. The court also learned that at the same trial Beggs was convicted of two charges of wounding and sentenced to four months for each. He was also jailed for six years in 1991 for slashing the leg of a man who escaped by jumping through a glass window. Beggs has repeatedly tried and failed to have his conviction overturned at the Supreme Court.","Infamous Limbs in Loch killer William Beggs was attacked in prison .

Dawn arrived on 6 March, the first time a spacecraft has orbited a dwarf planet, and is now preparing for the key science phase of the mission. However, the images have not yet revealed what the mystery ‘bright spots’ on the surface of the world are, which have gripped the attention of scientists and the public alike. Nasa scientists in California have released new images of Ceres (shown). They were taken by the Dawn spacecraft from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km). The spacecraft is beginning to move closer and closer to Ceres. And it will soon study the whole planet - including its mystery bright spots . The latest images were taken on 10 April from a distance of 21,000 miles (33,000km), and are the highest-resolution views of Ceres so far. The spacecraft is currently on the side of the planet that is mostly shrouded in darkness, but over the coming months it will see more of the world in light. And it will also see Ceres in better and a higher resolution. Ceres is 590 miles (950 km) across and was discovered in 1801. It is the closest dwarf planet to the sun and is located in the asteroid belt, making it the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system. Ceres is the smallest of the bodies currently classified as a 'dwarf planet'. It lies less than three times as far as Earth from the sun - close enough to feel the warmth of the star, allowing ice to melt and reform. Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has been making its way to Ceres from the asteroid Vesta since September 2012. There is high interest in the mission because Ceres because it is seen as being a record of the early solar system, and may also have shifting ice on its surface. Ceres is the largest body in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, with an average diameter of 590 miles (950km). Dawn has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first ‘science orbit’ will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May. After this, it will begin making lower and lower orbits to get better views of the surface. The mission will allow scientists to study the last major body between Earth and Jupiter that has yet to be explored. 'The mission is so exciting, because we're exploring the last uncharted world of the solar system,' Dr Marc Rayman, Dawn chief engineer and mission director at JPL told MailOnline. 'For me the opportunity to travel to this distant alien world that has been known of for two centuries, a mysterious world of rock and ice, perhaps with subsurface liquid water maybe stored as ponds, lakes or oceans, is very exciting.' Shown above is an animation of Ceres rotating as Dawn observed its north pole. Ceres is about 2.8 times further from the sun than Earth, and a day on the dwarf planet lasts nine Earth hours. Credit: Nasa . Dawn (artist's illustration shown) has been using its ion propulsion system to rendezvous with the dwarf planet since leaving the giant asteroid Vesta in 2012. Its first ‘science orbit’ will begin on 23 April, with the spacecraft remaining a distance of 8,400 miles (13,500km) away until 9 May . In the next few weeks and months, the dwarf planet will be studied in great detail. But the most impressive images will be returned in December, when Dawn starts one of its lowest science orbits. It will be at an altitude of just 225 miles (360km) above the surface - below the orbital height of the International Space Station around Earth - allowing it to get high resolution images of the surface. The primary science mission for the spacecraft will last until June 2016 - by which the team expects to have achieved all of its scientific goals -and it is unlikely the spacecraft will be extended beyond that date, as it will probably start running out of fuel by then. This map-projected view of Ceres was created from images taken by Nasa's Dawn spacecraft during its initial approach to the dwarf planet, prior to being captured into orbit in March 2015. Differences in morphology and color across the surface suggest Ceres was once an active body . Perhaps of most interest, though, are the mystery bright spots on the surface. These are thought to possibly be expanses of ice inside a crater on Ceres. Based on new infrared images released by Nasa the other day, it appears that the pair of spots have different thermal properties - suggesting they have different origins. They could also be towering ‘water volcanoes’, but more observations will be needed to confirm or deny this. 'The bright spots continue to fascinate the science team, but we will have to wait until we get closer and are able to resolve them before we can determine their source,' said Chris Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles. These images, from Dawn's visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR), highlight two regions on Ceres containing bright spots.

Hannah Moore, 20, of Broxburn in West Lothian, uploaded the snaps in a bid to boost her confidence and told her followers: 'Nobody should be judged by their size because everyone is beautiful'. But only two minutes later, the mum of twins claims her account was deleted because the images were deemed to contain inappropriate 'nudity and violence'. Hannah Moore, 20, of Broxburn in West Lothian, had suffered stretchmarks after having twins, and had posted the images in a bid to boost her confidence . 'Nobody should be judged by their size because everyone is beautiful': The mum-of-twins had posted the images with an inspirational caption, and was shocked when they were removed due to 'nudity and violence' Hannah says the blocking of her account has made her think her body is 'clearly fat, ugly and disgusting and it made people feel sick'. She said: 'Two minutes after the picture was uploaded my account got closed down, my mouth just dropped and my eyes watered. 'I don't know why, it was out of the blue but I decided to post a picture of my belly on Instagram because I've had twins. 'I had written underneath the picture how unconfident I had always been, how relationships have been hard and how hard it is to find clothes that I like.' The 20-year-old had had suffered stretchmarks after having twins and wanted a confidence boost, but after posting images (pictured right), her account was immediately shut down . 'Instagram should be more careful in whose accounts they delete and look into it further': Moore was devastated by Instagram's decision to delete her account . She continued: 'I want not just myself but other women thin or bigger to love themselves and love their size because everyone is beautiful. 'Instagram should be more careful whose accounts they delete and look into it further.' Hannah suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls Lily and Grace with fiance David Johnstone, 22, in June last year. She posted the pictures on Wednesday but her account was immediately shut down. She said: 'I basically wrote that people should never get judged for the size and what they look like because everyone is beautiful'. 'The picture was up two minutes until my Instagram logged out itself and then it came up saying my account has been shut down because of violations. 'Nobody could get on my Instagram and nobody could search for it so someone had obviously reported the picture for nudity - all it was was a picture of my belly and it has just took my confidence away.' Hannah suffered from stretch marks after giving birth to twin girls Lily and Grace with fiance David Johnstone, 22 (pictured right), in June last year . She added: 'It was just me saying that nobody should ever get judged no matter what size they are. 'I felt so confident posting the picture showing my baby belly, my belly that carried twin girls for only six months.' Instagram's community guidelines state: 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don't allow nudity on Instagram.

The niece of Gypsy Weddings star Paddy Doherty has been jailed for two years after she and an accomplice preyed on elderly people in their homes in 'cruel and heinous raids'. Chantelle Doherty, 21, of Prestwich, Greater Manchester, was involved in a raid on the home of a 92-year-old man in which she and another man bluffed their way in and stole several bottles of whisky, a decanter and a phone. Her friend Martin Lawrence, 27, also targeted a man aged 99 claiming he owed him money for non existing paving work. The incidents occurred after Doherty was freed from jail having been in prison for 16 months for leading a gypsy girl gang which carried out a string of vicious robberies. Doherty has now been jailed for two years after pleading guilty to burglary and fraud. Lawrence, of no fixed address, was jailed for five years after he pleaded guilty to three counts of burglary, three counts of fraud and one count each of robbery and attempted theft. Police said the offending began on November 9, 2013, when Lawrence and another man went to the home of the 99-year old man in Salford claiming to work for a paving company and asked the man if he wanted any work doing. He told them he did not but over the next few days they returned and called the victim on several occasions and persuaded him to hand over a large amount of money. A few days later Lawrence returned asking for more money but the man refused. Lawrence asked him for a drink and when the man went to make him one Lawrence went upstairs, where the man found him rooting through his drawers and told him to leave. He later found his wallet had been stolen and rang the police. Lawrence also returned in February and March 2014 asking to do more work on the driveway, but the man refused and called the police. Later on December 3 Lawrence went to the home of a 92-year-old man in Salford, pretending to be a charity collector. Doherty (pictured left) has been jailed for two years and accomplice Martin Lawrence (right) for five years . The man donated £5 to what he believed to be a good cause, but while Lawrence was there he stole £130 from the man's wallet and his credit card. On December 9 Lawrence approached a 54-year-old man in his garden at his home falsely claiming to be from the police and asked the man if they could go into his house to talk about a recent crime. The man became suspicious and asked to see his ID, which is when Lawrence showed the stolen credit card. The man asked Lawrence to leave and there was a struggle between the pair before Lawrence stole his wallet which contained a debit card and Tesco mobile top up card, and made off. A short time after this incident, Lawrence and Doherty went into a pub in Pendlebury, and ordered around £70 worth of food and drinks. They left the stolen debit card as payment but this was declined, so they told staff they would return to their hotel room next door to get another card, but they never came back. As they left, Lawrence was carrying a bottle of Amigo beer. Doherty is the niece of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celebrity Big Brother star Paddy Doherty (pictured) The pair then went to the home of the 92-year-old victim from a few days previously and persuaded him to let them in, where they stole several bottles of whisky, a decanter, phone and replaced his credit card with the stolen Tesco mobile top up card. The next day a relative of the man went to visit him and noticed a bottle of Amigo beer in the living room. DNA from the bottle was later matched to Lawrence. At an earlier hearing Doherty was said to have had no formal education and was unable to read and write and her role in the community is a 'particular role handed down to females in her position.' She was previously jailed aged 18 when she led a five-strong ladette mob which ambushed and bullied youngsters in the street and robbed them of valuables. During one incident Doherty - whose 52-year old uncle won the 2011 reality TV show Celebrity Big Brother - head butted a young boy, forced a fizzy drink down another terrified boy's throat  and poured alcohol over another. In one of the five hold ups across Salford, Greater Manchester, a girl of eight was forcibly pushed up a road on her bicyle and left crying hysterically after being robbed of her mobile phone. Another young girl was told 'if you call the police, we'll kill you, we're Gypsies,' before she was robbed of her Blackberry. Doherty, the eldest of the gang, was said to have been the most aggressive of the girls - even kicking out at a police officer as she was arrested. At today's court hearing she was said to be thoroughly ashamed and felt 'she's brought shame on her family, her community.' PC Michelle Ingham of Greater Manchester Police said: 'It is difficult to convey the devastating impact these cruel acts have had on these two victims. 'Lawrence repeatedly targeted two vulnerable elderly men in the sanctity of their own homes, a place where they should feel safe and where they and their families had worked hard to ensure these two men could still enjoy a high level of independence in their old age. 'As a direct result of what happened here, one of these men has had to move out of his family home, where until this point he had lived happily, and into residential care, which is simply heart-wrenching for both him and his family. 'I hope that today's sentencing acts as a warning to others who may think they can get away with targeting more vulnerable members in our society - this sort of heinous crime is one that we take extremely seriously and we will do everything in our power to trace those responsible and put them behind bars for their actions.'","Chantelle Doherty, 21, jailed for preying on elderly people in their homes .

Pictures from state-controlled media show the dictator smiling and waving, with his right wrist in bandages . It is the latest in a string of presumed health problems for the North Korean dictator, aged 32 . According to a South Korean official, quoted in Sky News, Jong-Un must have suffered the injury in the recent past. 'He didn't have the injury when he inspected a military unit on April 4,' the government spokesman said, 'so it must be recent.' Doctors who have examined the photos say it is unlikely that he has fractured his wrist, and judged it to be a minor injury. The state of Kim Jong-Un's health is the subject of fascination around the globe, as he presides over the world's most secretive state. Kim Jong-un resurfaced after six weeks of no appearances in October, walking with the help of a walking stick. There were rumours that he had had a gastric band fitted, or suffering from gout which put pressure on his feet . Pictured here with army generals in 2012, King Jong-Un is named the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He has previously revealed plans to launch nuclear strikes on US cities . In autumn 2014 he vanished for six weeks after he was spotted limping across a stage - sparking speculation that an attempted coup in the country or health problems including a leg injury, gout or a gastric band operation were behind the disappearance.. During that time state media reported he was suffering from an unnamed 'uncomfortable physical condition'.

1237,bb0d2ac342a86544b38da9fd31bfcb560c722f0a,"David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work after Britain was singled out as one of the few 'bright spots' in the global economy. The Prime Minister will vow to encourage more job creation by extending national insurance breaks, worth at least £2,000 a year to smaller firms taking on new staff, for a further five years. Saying he is 'really angry' at Labour's claim that the Conservatives are 'the party for the few, not the many', Mr Cameron will hail the 'jobs miracle' that has seen 1,000 new jobs created every day. David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work . Contrasting that with Labour's record, he will claim Ed Miliband's economic policies could see 'a million more people joining the dole queues'. Last night, in a boost for George Osborne, the head of the International Monetary Fund picked out the UK recovery as exemplary. Christine Lagarde said the world was suffering from a 'moderate and uneven' return to growth which was 'simply not good enough'. But, in an endorsement of the Government's economic record, she cited the United States and the United Kingdom as countries where the outlook is positive. The comments completed an extraordinary volte-face by the IMF on the Coalition's handling of the economy. Just two years ago, it warned that Mr Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity – only to see the economic recovery take off. Britain was the best performing major economy in the developed world last year, with growth of 2.8 per cent. Figures published by the fund also show it has overtaken socialist-run France to become the second most powerful economy in Europe behind Germany. However, the IMF predicted Britain would still be running a deficit at the end of the decade – despite Tory efforts to balance the books. Cameron will say if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of last Labour government there will be a risk to jobs . Mr Cameron, who dismissed the projections, will today launch a Conservative 'jobs manifesto' setting out plans to bring about 'full employment' – meaning everyone who wants a job has one. 'We are living through a jobs miracle – brought to you by a Conservative government that has backed business, reformed welfare and rewarded work,' he will say. Claiming Mr Miliband represents a threat to jobs, he will add: 'You know what makes me really angry? It's when our opponents still go on about 'you Tories – the party for the few and not the many…' Excuse me? 'This is the party that's taken three million of the lowest-paid workers out of income tax altogether; that's cut the taxes of 26million working people; that's seen 1,000 jobs created every day – jobs that are giving families security, putting food on tables, helping people out of poverty. 'Under the last five years of Labour, unemployment went up by 600 people a day. 'So if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last Labour government – that he was a part of – he risks a million more people joining the dole queues.' The jobs manifesto will include a guarantee to maintain the so-called 'employment allowance' until 2020, meaning a third of employers will continue to pay no jobs tax for another five years. The tax break, which helps smaller businesses take on new workers by freeing businesses from at least the first £2,000 of employers' national insurance, has already been taken up by 856,000 firms. David Cameron pictured on a metal platform yesterday (left) and John Major on his soap box in 1992 (right) One of the most abiding images from the 1992 General Election campaign was the moment John Major got on his soap box. And yesterday David Cameron did the same... but gave it a 21st century twist by taking to a folding metal platform. During a campaign stop in Leeds, the Prime Minister raised himself above the closely packed crowd to engage in a question and answer session with employees at the O2 office in Morley and Outwood – the marginal constituency of shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Major climbed onto an old fashioned soap box in Cheltenham to persuade Conservatives to come out and vote in 1992, just ten days before the election.

The occupational therapy student, who studied at Glasgow Caledonian Univerity, disappeared on April 11 after telling friends she was going to the loo at the Sanctuary club. Flatmates at her home in Garnethill in the city centre raised the alarm when she failed to return from the night out.

Murdered preacher Abdul Hadi Arwani was killed by a hitman who climbed into the back of his car, it emerged last night. The Syrian-born 48-year-old was lured to an upmarket street in London on the pretence of providing a quote for some building work. But when the imam arrived, the killer got into the rear seat of his Volkswagen Passat and shot him several times. The murder at 11.15am on Tuesday bears all the hallmarks of a professional assassination because the gunman was thought to have used a silencer and it took place away from CCTV cameras. Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers are investigating whether Mr Arwani, a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, was murdered on the orders of the regime. They suspect the part-time builder was tricked into driving to Wembley to quote for a job – but the killer was put off when the imam took his teenage son along and claimed he could not find the keys to the house. He is thought to have been executed when the mystery client – described as having an African accent – asked Mr Arwani to return a second time alone. Shortly after the shooting Mr Arwani's car was discovered 'perfectly parked' on the side of the road with the engine still running and with one of the windows wound down. The father-of-six from Acton, west London, had links to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group outlawed in Syria and other countries in the Middle East. He is understood to have been a member of the organisation until about seven years ago, but retained ties to some of the group's senior figures.

It is thought that when the imam arrived, the killer got into his Volkswagen Passat . Mr Arwani was a fierce critic of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who is pictured above in September 2013 . Mr Arwani fled Syria in 1982 after a massacre in his home city of Hama carried out on the orders of Assad's father, Hafez. The imam, who moved to Britain in the mid-1990s after studying Islamic law in Jordan, claimed he was sentenced to death in his absence by the Syrian regime. He was involved in violent anti-Assad demonstrations outside the Syrian Embassy in London three years ago. Police were forced to use riot shields to beat back protesters after they broke through barriers, and six people were arrested. Mr Arwani told reporters during the demonstration: 'This building belongs to the Syrian people, not a regime killing people every single day for ten months.' Detectives are also considering whether the father of six was killed by someone associated with the notorious An Noor mosque in Acton where he was imam from 2005 to 2011.","Abdul Hadi Arwani found dead in his 'perfectly parked' car on Tuesday .

6341,2b1b6a434b171e198413479aaba118f0cd20c843,"Durham, North Carolina (CNN)President Obama's nomination of Loretta Lynch to become the country's first African-American woman attorney general is a historic pick.  Her confirmation, however, is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full Senate drags into its sixth month. The period between the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote to confirm and the full Senate vote -- which in Lynch's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history. By the time the Senate returns from Easter recess on Monday, it'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined. Lynch, currently the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, cleared the committee February 26 by a vote of 12-8, with Republican Sens. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona joining Democrats in sending the nomination to the full Senate. Obama nominated Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder on November 8, after Holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier. Hundreds of miles from Washington, longtime residents of Durham, North Carolina, were beaming with pride.  Lynch's family moved to the city when she was a child.  Her parents, married for 60 years, still live there.  They watched the announcement on television . ""That was encouraging but I knew then that we had a fight on our hands,"" said Lynch's father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch.  ""I've been in politics most of my life. I know that nothing is certain, and I know that nothing is easy."" Lorenzo Lynch, 82, is a retired Baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  He ran, unsuccessfully, for mayor of Durham in 1973. For the next round of his daughter's ""fight,"" he traveled to Washington in late January to attend his daughter's confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee. ""I heard a lot at that hearing that I've heard since childhood.  That is the presupposition of the mindset,"" Lorenzo Lynch said.  ""The dual system or the dual treatment."" When asked to provide specific examples, Lorenzo Lynch deferred to the state branch of the NAACP and E. Lavonia Allison, a Durham activist who has known Loretta Lynch since the family moved to Durham. ""I don't want to think about the epidermis, but some people are thinking that way,"" Allison said, suggesting that Lynch's confirmation vote has been delayed because Lynch is African-American. ""When it has taken so long, when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different?"" Allison said. In March, Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said, ""I think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay, but it's also the irrationality of the new Republicans."" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, evoked imagery of the segregated South in criticism of Republicans, saying Lynch had been ""asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar."" Durbin was harshly criticized by Arizona's Sen. John McCain. ""I deeply regret that the senator from Illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation, mine and my Republican colleagues,"" McCain said on the Senate floor.  ""It was offensive and unnecessary, and I think he owes this body, Ms. Lynch and all Americans an apology,"" McCain added. ""I thought he should be commended,"" Lorenzo Lynch said.  ""I think that's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry, like most language, is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point."" Giuliani pushes for Lynch confirmation . Senate Republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on Lynch's nomination is because she is African-American. Many point out that Lynch, if confirmed, will be replacing the country's first African-American attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin. Instead, Republicans and Democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle.  For some, it's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the Senate.  For others, the delay is retaliation for President Obama's 2014 executive actions on immigration. On the eve of Holder's announcement of his plans to leave the Department of Justice, the political number crunchers at FiveThirtyEight.com predicted that whoever the President nominated would ""likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the Senate."" Some of Lynch's supporters across North Carolina have organized to convince the state's two Republican senators to support Lynch's confirmation.  In March, several dozen North Carolina women, led by the NAACP, traveled to Washington to meet with their senators, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis. Reportedly, the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial. At a news conference at the Washington Press Club, the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination. ""Senator Burr and Senator Tillis, it is time for you to act like you have some sense.  It's past time.  You have embarrassed the state of North Carolina,"" Allison said after the meeting. For their part, Burr and Tillis released a statement after the meeting: ""While we remain concerned with Ms. Lynch's stated desire to lead the Department of Justice in the same manner as Eric Holder and will not be supporting her nomination, we are grateful that the group came to Washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas. Weeks later, the NAACP organized protests outside the senators' offices in Raleigh, Charlotte and Wilmington. ""I think there is a much deeper analysis,"" said North Carolina NAACP Branch President Rev. William Barber II.  ""I believe if she had been Clarence Thomas, she would have been confirmed."" ""Because of her courage, her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land, particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution, and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear,"" Barber said. Obama turns up the heat on Loretta Lynch confirmation 'limbo' Lorenzo Lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders.  He admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of African-Americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights. Now, his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter's nomination and photos of his visit to the White House. Lynch admits that he's never told his only daughter that he's proud of her, although he's sure she knows it.  He plans to change that, soon, regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination.","The nomination of Loretta Lynch as U.S. attorney general was announced in November .

The world's media were keen to get even more footage of the Augusta champion after his big weekend . It was the disappointment of last year that ultimately carried Spieth to victory and the legacy he craved . 'So the combination of the two allowed me to keep my head down, not worry about anyone else in the field except myself and to play a golf course that is my favorite course in the world,' he said. The par-5 eighth hole is where it all started to go wrong last year. He had a two-shot lead and made bogey to Watson's birdie. On the ninth hole, Spieth's shot came up a fraction short and tumbled down the front of the green and back into the fairway, leading to another bogey. Watson birdied and suddenly was two shots ahead, and Spieth didn't have the power or the putting to catch up. This year was different. His lead down to three shots, Spieth made a simple birdie on the eighth hole. This time, his approach on the ninth was fraction long enough to land on the ridge and stay put. He made par, and Justin Rose had a three-putt bogey to fall five shots behind. He was runner-up in the Texas Open and lost in a playoff at the Houston Open before arriving at Augusta . Bubba Watson presents Spieth  with the green jacket after his 18-under total secured him the victory . There was only one shaky moment after that. Spieth was four shots ahead and looking at a two-shot swing on the 16th when Rose had 15 feet for birdie and Spieth faced an 8-foot putt for par. Rose missed. Spieth made. He was on his way. 'It was probably one of the best putts he hit all day,' Rose said. It's tempting to declare Spieth as golf's next big star after such a performance and the elite company he joins. In the last century, only four players have three PGA Tour titles that include a major before turning 22 - Spieth, Woods, Tom Creavy and Gene Sarazen. He was the first wire-to-wire winner at Augusta in 39 years. He already is No 2 in the world, and he still has work to do to reach Rory McIlroy at No 1. Justin Rose praised Spieth's put on the 16th that he missed to set him on his way as 'one of the best' Golf is craving a rivalry, and this has all the trappings of one, especially because the world ranking has never had No 1 and No 2 both 25 or younger. It's worth waiting to see if other young players emerge the rest of the year in the majors, such as Jason Day or even Hideki Matsuyama, who finished fifth. But that Friday at Augusta, when Spieth shot 66 and built a five-shot lead, felt a lot like Friday at Congressional when McIlroy began to bury the U.S. Open field in 2011. 'He's way more mature than I was at 21, and a hell of a golfer and a great person as well,' McIlroy said. Rory McIlroy is currently world No 1 and while Spieth is far behind at No 2, golf is craving a top rivalry . McIlroy was not ready to think about a rivalry, even though he stated his goal very clearly that he wants to be No 1. This was a big step, but it was only a step. 'He's got four majors,' Spieth said of McIlroy. 'That's something I can still only dream about.' If history is any indication, the kid is a quick study. And he seems to be in a hurry to get where he's going.","Jordan Spieth won the Masters at Augusta in record fashion on Sunday .

The 38-year-old boxer has shared a video flaunting his diamond-encrusted watches, fleet of super-cars and carpets of cash on his Instagram account. The 15-second video shot by director James 'JP' Dayap, a proud member of The Money Team brand owned by Mayweather, hits out at his supposed haters. Scroll down for videos . Cash: Floyd Mayweather (pictured) has shared a video to his 5 million Instagram followers where he hits back at his supposed 'haters' Party: The 15-second video showing off his extravagant lifestyle even features a room full of half-naked girls twerking (pictured) for his amusement .

Wealth: Rapper Yo Gotti's song blares over footage of the five-division champion inspecting his fleet of super cars (pictured) Petrol head: Mayweather then walks past another row of expensive cars which seem to include Porsches and Ferraris . Bling: The footage which was shot and edited by director James 'JP' Dayap - a proud member of Mayweather's The Money Team brand - features rows of jewel-encrusted watches . Super-fight: The 38-year-old boxer (pictured) is expected to earn around £120million for his upcoming bout against Manny Pacquiao . Rapper Yo Gotti's song blares over the footage of Mayweather's opulent life and essentially lists his many expensive possessions which include: 'Big crib, ten cars, twenty acres.' As the lyrics boast 'I could write a book about money', the five-division world champion sits at his coffee table counting his endless piles of cash. The video then cuts to rows of luxurious Rolex watches adorned with jewels and Mayweather standing proudly in front of his Las Vegas mansion. A few seconds of the video even show four half-naked women twerking, supposedly for the boxer's pleasure. It surfaces just two weeks before one of the most anticipated fights in recent boxing history, when he takes on eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao. With the two fighters' management teams and the hosts MGM Grand locked in a stand-off between ticket allocations, they have yet to go on public sale.

Business: Mayweather's The Money Team clothing brand (logo pictured) has been worn by stars like Justin Bieber and billionaire Warren Buffet . 'Normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight,' according to Connor Gregoire, an analyst for SeatGeek. He added: 'It is bizarre... To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Tickets for the fight were expected to cost between £1,000 and £5,000 in the 16,500-seat Grand Garden arena in the Las Vegas Casino. But those prices have incredibly tripled in the resale market before they have even gone on public sale. Mayweather's promoter said that tickets would go on sale this week for the May 2 fight but MGM Grand's officials have been tight-lipped about their availability.

The hotel issued a statement on Friday saying there would be a 'limited number of tickets available for sale' and that it is working with promoters to finalise a date for their release. Meanwhile Pacquiao's manager blamed the opposing fighter's camp for holding up the ticket sales, claiming they refused to sign an agreement drawn up months ago. Michael Koncz said: 'It's a real mess right now... I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the hold up? 'Millions of dollars are at stake in the dispute because after the MGM takes its share, each camp gets a certain percentage of tickets and is able to resell them with ticket brokers for higher prices.","He released the video flaunting his wealth to 5 million Instagram followers .

9475,d1817ab81ef20f2cbaa84918e259bc0fbdc1c917,"A nine-year-old girl who plummeted 30ft headfirst down the inside of a hollow tree claims she 'went to heaven and sat in Jesus's lap' while unconscious after the fall. Her mother, Christy Wilson Beam, 42, has spoken of her amazement after  Annabel, now 12, escaped the horrifying accident unscathed - even waking miraculously cured of a devastating illness that had plagued her childhood. For the first time in her life, she can eat solid food – and her mother thinks her brush with Jesus is the reason why. Scroll down for video . Annabel Beam, now 12, believes she visited Heaven when unconscious after falling 30ft at the age of nine . Annabel (centre), with her mother Christy and father Kevin and her sisters Abigail (right) and Adelynn (left) In December, 2011, Annabel was playing outside the family's Texas home with her sisters Abigail, now 14 and Adelynn, now ten, when she slipped and fell inside a hollowed-out cottonwood tree. Mum Christy said: 'She hit her head three times on the way down and this is consistent with the findings of an MRI scan. 'With the facts in front of me now, I see it all with sickening clarity. 'Sometimes at night, it replays in my head – a dark twist on Alice tumbling down the rabbit hole.' An emergency fire crew managed to harness Annabel to safety and she was rushed to Cook Children's Hospital in Fort Worth in a helicopter. Fearing the worst, medics prepped brain and spinal injury teams to stand by for Annabel's arrival – but, incredibly, she survived without a scratch. Video: Today . Annabel survived the horrific fall with only bumps and bruises. The doctors said 'I guess someone up there was looking out for her' Annabel's mother, Christy, and father, Kevin, believe their daughter, saying she 'has no interest in melodrama' Doctors told her relieved parents: 'I guess someone up there was looking out for her.' 'The ER doc told us the one thing we weren't expecting to hear,' her mother said. 'He said, ""Other than a possibly concussion and some superficial bumps and bruises, she doesn't appear to have been injured at all."" '[My husband] Kevin and I exchanged a look of pure astonishment.' In the days following the accident, Annabel began to talk of religious visions she experienced while lying unconscious. She told her parents: 'I went to heaven when I was in that tree. I sat in Jesus' lap.' 'I saw in Anna's eyes the conscious decision to confide in us,' Christy said. 'There was no drama, she wasn't playing either. 'This wasn't like one of her long, spun-out recaps of a funny dream or movie she'd seen. 'She'd been through enough real drama in her short life. She had no interest in melodrama. '[She described] some of what she'd experienced while inside the tree – how the gates of Heaven are made of gold, how Jesus told her it wasn't time.' A cross marks the hollowed-out cottonwood tree, where Annabel plummeted 30ft headfirst to the bottom . Initially, Christy was concerned that Annabel was indicating a head injury, but MRI and CT scans revealed she had not sustained one. Further tests also revealed Annabel had remarkably stopped displaying symptoms of pseudo-obstruction motility disorder, a rare incurable condition that had seen her in and out of hospital since 2008. Doctors advised she could begin to come off the antibiotics she had been taking for years. Instead of taking ten different types of medication throughout the day, she only needed three, and the painkillers that were prescribed 'as and when she needed them' were not required at all. Previously, Annabel's medication meant she had to have a liquid diet or stick to soft, bland food – but now, she can happily tuck into pizzas and McDonald's happy meals. The family have gone more than a year without a single visit to the doctor. 'I can't explain what happened to her physically while she was in that tree,' said her father Kevin. 'All I have to go on is the radiological data and the medical records from before and after. 'The proof is in the pudding. She wasn't well before and now she is. 'All I know beyond that is that she believes she went to Heaven. And I believe her when she tells me she believes it.' Nine-year-old Annabel was playing outside with her sisters Abigail and Adelynn when she fell inside the tree . Annabel said she saw a fairy-like guardian angel as she gained consciousness, and it stayed with her while she was rescued, shining a light so she could see . Annabel talked of seeing a 'guardian angel' as she came to. The schoolgirl said: 'I started to wake up in the tree and I could hear the firemen's voices. And I saw an angel that looked very small, like a fairy. 'And the God winked at me through the body of the angel and what He was saying to me was, 'I'm going to leave you now and everything is going to be okay. 'And then the angel stayed with me the entire time, shining a light so I could see. We didn't talk. We just sat together peacefully.' She also spoke of seeing Mimi, her great-grandmother who'd died in 2010 after surgery on a blocked intestine. When asked what Jesus looked like, Annabel said: 'He had a beautiful long white robe, dark skin and a big beard – kinda like Santa Claus, but not really.'","Nine-year-old 'saw Heaven and sat in Jesus's lap' while unconscious .

3231,4e9a55363c8da6aca70c53379a093fe5e1fba5c3,"(CNN)This is week three of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible. Read week one and week two. When I started this project, my brother texted me, ""Wait until you get to Lot."" By Sunday afternoon, I understood what he meant. I am horrified by the story of Lot in Genesis. Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was new to me. I actually hadn't put two and two together that Sodom is the origin of the word sodomy. (Feel free to call me dense as you read this). Lot is the central character in the grim story of Sodom and Gomorrah's demise in Chapter 19. You are introduced to the city by Abraham who tries to save the town. In the preceding chapter, Abraham asks God to agree that if he can find 10 good people in the town, God won't smite it. God agrees. Lot is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town. The men of the town come to seek out the new visitors for ""intimacies."" Ahem. Yeah. Hospitable bunch, huh? Those ""intimacies,"" we are meant to understand, account for Sodom's wickedness. And I guess meant that the town was doomed. (""Intimacies"" is the term used in my 1991 edition of the New American Bible. The revised edition refers to ""sexual relations."") To protect the emissaries from the mob, Lot offers up his virginal daughters. Which. Ugh. Anyway, it doesn't work. There apparently aren't enough good men to save Sodom, which leads to God destroying yet another population in Genesis. Oh, and while Lot's chosen family members flee the destruction, Lot's wife turns around and is turned to salt. She had been warned not to look back. After God destroys Sodom, Lot's daughters worry that there aren't any men left, so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him. They need to have children to keep the human race going, the logic goes, I guess. After reading that section, I put my Bible down. I couldn't read anymore. Then I read it again. What was I reading? What are the morals, the meaning, I'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories? This is not the God that I have known for nearly 42 years. It's not the version of the God I pray to daily. I truly don't believe in a God that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality. Why are they wicked? I don't believe that my God that would go after one group -- any group. The God that I pray to doesn't punish the ""wicked"" like this. I can't comprehend this version of God. I can't believe in that kind of God. There were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that I read. But, I want to be truthful with you, my readers. The Lot story struck me -- hard. I wish that I had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago. But I don't. It could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children. Or it could be a morality tale for the times. The truth is: I don't really know. I just know that my faith doesn't include the idea of such a punitive God. I now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the Bible. And when I read this rough draft to my brother, he said to me, ""You have just hit the tip of the iceberg."" So, I will continue reading.","This is week three of an ongoing series: A Catholic Reads the Bible. Read week one and week two.
This week's reading is a Lot to take in. Literally."

The 14-time major champion is bidding to win his fifth green jacket, but has been plagued by a succession of injuries and even the chipping yips in recent times. The world will find out which version of Woods will turn up when he tees off in the penultimate group at 6.48pm. Defending champion Bubba Watson, hoping to win his third Masters title in four years, will tee off at 2.24pm alongside England's former US Open champion Justin Rose and 21-year-old South Korean amateur Gunn Yang, who earned the right to play in the prestigious group by winning the US Amateur last year. Those watching the 2.02pm group on Thursday could see some fireworks as two of the game's most colourful characters go head-to-head. Ian Poulter could hardly be described as a shrinking violet, but even he might meet his match in American young gun Patrick Reed, who earned himself a brash reputation by professing himself to be among the top five players in the world after his big win at Doral last year. He followed that up by shushing the home crowd during a cocksure display at Gleneagles. Three-time Masters champion Phil MIckelson, hitting from behind trees during practice, will play alongside McIlroy in the first two rounds . Ryan Moore, pictured during a practice round at Augusta, will join McIlroy and Mickelson on the course for round one and two . Woods will be accompanied with Wales' Jamie Donaldson and Jimmy Walker of the USA during the first two rounds of the competition . US Open champion Martin Kaymer is in the group behind world No 1 McIlroy, with Brandt Snedeker and Houston Open winner JB Holmes. McIlroy and Mickelson were among the players battling for the US PGA title in near-darkness at Valhalla last year, with Mickelson and Rickie Fowler stepping aside on the 18th to allow the final group of McIlroy and Bernd Wiesberger to tee off and beat the fading light. With 98 players in the field, Charley Hoffman and Brian Harman make up the first group out in the tournament proper at 12.45pm (7:45am local time), with Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus again acting as honorary starters five minutes earlier, the legendary duo hitting tee shots on the par-four first before retiring to the clubhouse while Arnold Palmer takes up a similar role but is unable to tee off as he is recovering from a dislocated shoulder. England's Danny Willett will begin his Masters debut in the second group at 12:56pm alongside 1987 winner Larry Mize and US amateur public links champion Byron Meth. Woods faces a lengthy wait before he can begin his bid for a fifth Masters title after being drawn in the penultimate group for the opening round. The American superstar has started just two events in 2015, carding a career-worst 82 to miss the cut in the first and withdrawing through injury after 11 holes of the second, but said he was ready to 'compete to win a golf tournament' after 11 holes of practice on Monday. The final group tees off at 1:59pm and features three players ranked in the top 13 in the world, Australia's Jason Day, Spain's Sergio Garcia and Fowler.

4279,ce18162c57c41ac03c43f5c199866e4f373e09b7,"Andy Flower, England team director who guided sides to three Ashes triumphs and the world No 1 spot, will not be interfering in any way with the work of the next director of England cricket. The England Cricket Board gave Flower the confusing title of technical director of elite coaching after he renegotiated a new role at significantly lower pay after resigning as team boss following the last Ashes whitewash. This has led to speculation that Flower’s continuing role on the ECB staff would conflict with the job description of the new appointment. Former England team director Andy Flower is now technical director of elite coaching at the ECB . But effectively Flower is now running the England cricket academy at Loughborough and working with young players in a coaching role, and liaising with counties. And it’s understood he has no wish to get involved at England senior level again or become entangled in the politics. Those politics have Kevin Pietersen at centre stage as ever. But Flower, having closed one chapter in his life and fully moved on to his behind-the-scenes Loughborough role, is highly unlikely to speak out about KP now. Meanwhile, Pietersen, who is using social media app Periscope to film himself getting a sun tan or whistling, continues to dominate the PR battle against the ECB, who botched his axing and have totally mismanaged the fall-out since. Kevin Pietersen is back playing cricket for Surrey in the hope of winning back a Test spot in the England side . It looks only a matter of time before Manuel Pellegrini is sacked as Manchester City manager. And his son Juan, who is living in England, isn’t waiting for the axe to fall on his father, having already made plans to take his wife and four children back to Chile. However, Juan’s return is purely for family reasons with his wife, who has just had twins, wanting family support to look after four kids who are under the age of five. Only the ECB’s hopeless media team could launch the domestic NatWest T20 Blast, which needs all the promotional hype it can muster to compete with the IPL and Big Bash, on the same day as an England Test match. And only the ECB, having brought in former Ashes hero Freddie Flintoff to drum up publicity for the launch, could then decide he shouldn’t speak to national newspapers. An ECB spokesman said the date wasn’t ideal but they were constrained by the domestic and international schedule. And the print media snub was due to the ECB having limited time with Flintoff. Andrew Flintoff (left) shares a joke with Warwickshire and England's Chris Woakes at the T20 Blast launch . There was a player for all 18 counties present at the T20 Blast launch on Thursday . It can cause problems in football when agents represent players and managers. But the ECB have no concerns that former county cricketer Luke Sutton represents both Jimmy Anderson and England head coach Peter Moores. Likewise, the FA say they have no problems with England manager Roy Hodgson’s agent being Leon Angel who also looks after emerging international Danny Rose. Coincidentally, West Indies coach Phil Simmons is paid well enough to need the advice of David Manasseh, whose Stellar agency clients include the world’s most expensive footballer Gareth Bale. Sepp’s no messiah . Sepp Blatter’s smooth procession to a ridiculous fifth term as FIFA president continued at the Central American CONCACAF Congress in the Bahamas.

A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which includes the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, as well as honouring Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. The seven-year-old came across the fossils at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile when he and his sister, Macarena were looking for decorative stones. They were playing at the site because their geologist parents, Manuel Suarez and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes mountain range. Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. However, more than a dozen specimens have now been excavated, including four skeletons, which demonstrate that the dinosaur combined a variety of unique anatomical traits. The dinosaur has been likened to a platypus, which is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom, because it's one of very few mammal to lay eggs, has venomous spurs and a paddle-shaped tail like a beaver, as well as webbed feet and a bill like a duck, among other idiosyncrasies. Most of the specimens discovered are the size of a turkey, but some isolated bones reveal the maximum size of Chilesaurus was around 10 feet (three metres) long, according to Chilean and Argentinian palaeontologists from institutions including the University of Birmingham who have studied the skeletons. Unusual: Fossils dating from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups, including relatively short arms, a long neck, small head and leaf-shaped teeth (pictured) Bizarre: Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The dinosaur itself, has a lengthy neck and must have had good balance (illustrated) Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics. The Late Jurassic dinosaur lived 145 million years ago. It has a small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus, but has two blunt fingers instead of sharp claws, like the Velociraptor, for example. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon. It has leaf-shaped teeth, similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs. Most unusually, the animal was a vegetarian, despite belonging the theopod family of dinosaurs, which were mostly fierce meat eaters. The dinosaur ranged in size from as small as a turkey to 10 ft (three metres) long. They discovered that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod the Velociraptor. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon - whereas it is actually classified in the other basic dinosaur division – Saurischia, according to the study published in the journal Nature. The different parts of the body of Chilesaurus were adapted to a particular diet and way of life, which was similar to other groups of dinosaurs. As a result of these habits, different regions of the body of Chilesaurus evolved resembling those present in other, unrelated groups of dinosaurs - a phenomenon called evolutionary convergence. Chilesaurus represents one of the most extreme cases of evolutionary convergence. For example, its leaf-shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs. 'Chilesaurus can be considered a ""platypus"" dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution,’ Martín Ezcurra, a researcher at the University of Birmingham explained. Painstaking: Close inspection of the fossils revealed that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod, the Velociraptor. The process of excavating the skeleton is shown . The presence of herbivorous theropods was, up until now, only known in close relatives of birds but Chilesaurus (illustrated left) shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than thought. Its fossils were found at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile, marked with a red star on the map, right . ‘In this process, a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures. ‘Chilesaurus provides a good example of how evolution works in deep time and it is one of the most interesting cases of convergent evolution documented in the history of life. 'Chilesaurus shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups.’ He believes that this study will force palaeontologists to take more care in identifying fragmented and isolated dinosaur bones. Dr Fernando Novas, of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, Argentina, led the research on Chilesaurus. Seven-year-old Diego Suárez (pictured left) came across the fossils when he and his sister, Macarena, were looking for decorative stones. He was at the site while his his geologist parents, Manuel Suarez (pictured right) and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes . Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. Here, a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils . He said: ‘Chilesaurus is the first complete dinosaur from the Jurassic Period found in Chile and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere. ‘Although plant-eating theropods have been recorded in North America and Asia, this is the first time a theropod with this characteristic has been found in a southern landmass. ‘Chilesaurus was an odd plant-eating dinosaur only to be found in Chile. ‘However, the recurrent discovery in beds of the Toqui Formation of its bones and skeletons clearly demonstrates that Chilesaurus was, by far, the most abundant dinosaur in southwest Patagonia 145 million years ago.' The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over the course of 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping the unlikely transformation. The tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs, which gave rise to modern birds, were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller. The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping their unlikely transformation . Theropods, meaning ‘beast-footed’, were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. 'These bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations, such as feathers, wishbones and wings, four times faster than other dinosaurs,' said co-author Darren Naish, a palaeontologist at the University of Southampton. Lead author Associate Professor Michael Lee, from the University of Adelaide, said: 'Birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs.' 'Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities, such as the ability to climb trees, glide and fly. ‘Ultimately, this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins.' Researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree. They used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches.","Chilesaurus diegosuarezi was discovered by a child in southern Chile .

Maya Angelou, the acclaimed author of such classics as I Know Why the Cage Bird Sings and On the Pulse of Morning, which she read at Bill Clinton's inauguration in 1993, was issued a Forever stamp in honor of her many achievements and contributions. First Lady Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey were just two of the big names in attendance for the unveiling which gave the public a first look at the stamp, which features a picture of Angelou's face and one of her many memorable quotes. The problem however, is that the featured quote came from another author. Scroll down for video . A quote attributed to Maya Angelou on her commemorative stamp released by the US Postal Service is actually that of another writer . The stamp was unveiled Tuesday at an event featuring First Lady Michelle Obama and Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan (above) Maya Angelou, the acclaimed author of such classics as I Know Why the Cage Bird Sings and On the Pulse of Morning, was issued the Forever stamp for her contributions to the arts and this country . 'A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song,' reads the stamp, a quote that has long been attributed to Angelou, with President Obama even using the famous line as he honored the poet at the 2013 National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medal. What's more, The Washington Post found proof of an interview in which Angelou herself used the quote. Joan Walsh Anglund wrote in her 1967 book A Cup of Sun; 'A bird doesn’t sing because he has an answer, he sings because it has a song.' A few years before this quote first appeared though in 1969 with the publication of Angelou's aforementioned autobiography I Know Why the Cage Bird Sings, it was used in a children's book by another American author. Joan Walsh Anglund, now 89, wrote in her 1967 book A Cup of Sun; 'A bird doesn’t sing because he has an answer, he sings because it has a song.' In a statement released shortly after the origin of the quote was revealed, Postal Service spokesperson Mark Saunders said; 'The Postal Service used her widely recognized quote to help build an immediate connection between her image and her 1969 nationally recognized autobiography, ‘I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.' Saunders later added in an email to the Post that had they been aware of this fact they would have selected another of Angelou's famous lines. Angelou, who was born into poverty, holding down jobs as a fry cook, singer, and at one point even a prostitute, passed away last May. She was 86-years-old at the time, and had written, among other works, seven autobiographies, countless poems, and numerous scripts for theater, television and film. She also continued to teach throughout her life, spending the last four decades of her life as a professor at Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. As for Anglund, she seems remarkably nonplussed about the entire incident. 'I think it easily happens sometimes that people hear something, and it’s kind of going into your subconscious and you don’t realize it,' she explained. There are no plans to remove the limited edition stamp at this time .","A quote attributed to Maya Angelou on her commemorative stamp released by the US Postal Service is actually that of another writer .

However, the businesswoman and Apprentice judge was instead relegated to coat duty, helping Mr Cameron with his jacket as he stood to speak, before sitting politely with it on the sidelines. Baroness Brady, who is also the government’s small business ambassador, was appearing alongside Mr Cameronat a National Grid training centre in Newark, Nottinghamshire, to announce the creation of more trainee jobs for young people. Scroll down for video . Helping hand: Baroness Brady steps forward to help David Cameron with his jacket at an event today to promote new apprenticeships . Sidelined: TV star Ms Brady might have been hoping for a slightly more galmorous role when she agreed to the appearance with Mr Cameron, but instead sat politely holding his jacket . Campaign trail: She attended the speech along with Mr Cameron to announce the creation of 16,000 new apprenticeships at Costa, Morrisons, and the National Grid . Mr Cameron has pledged to create three million more apprenticeships over the next five years, if the Tories win the election. Costa Coffee and supermarket chain Morrisons have signed agreements to train thousands of apprentices each. Ministers will visited firms across the country to welcome fresh commitments from companies including Morrisons, who will train 9,000 apprentices; Crest Nicholson, who will take on 200 and announce a new training academy; and the National Grid, who will take on 500 new apprentices. Ahead of their campaign visit today, Baroness Brady said: ‘David Cameron’s commitment to delivering more apprenticeships is a fantastic boost for the long-term prospects of our young people.' She added: ‘With 2.2million starting since 2010 and another 3million more to start over the next five years, each apprenticeship is a chance for young people to master a trade, learn on the job and take home money in your pocket each week. ‘They’ve become more rigorous and respected too: we’ve got young people building engines for jet planes, working on massive engineering projects, innovating in science labs.’ The star of the BBC show The Apprentice said: ‘I remember that feeling of being 18, 19, 20 years old, hungry to get on and desperate for someone to give me an opportunity so I could prove myself. As soon as someone gives you a chance and believes in you – it’s a moment that can transform your life. ‘I’ve met many apprentices (apart from the Lord Sugar hopefuls) and you can see the pride written across their faces.’ TV star Karren Brady, pictured in Newark today, announced a series of deals with big businesses to create 16,000 new apprenticeships . David Cameron - on the campaign trail in Newark today- said the announcement shows the Conservatives continuing commitment to apprenticeships, which he wants to be 'level pegging' with university degress . Mr Cameron added: ‘There really has never been a better time to start an apprenticeship and it’s a huge leap forward to have even more of Britain’s most prestigious employers hiring apprentices. ‘We want apprenticeships to be level-pegging with a university degree, giving millions more people the dignity of work and a regular pay packet. ‘We’ve already created 2.2million apprenticeships since 2010, but a future Conservative government is committed to opening up 3million more high quality apprenticeships – to help strengthen our economy and communities and give millions more people financial security.’ Mr Cameron has pledged to create three million more apprenticeships over the next five years, if the Tories win the election .

8143,82b47b87a5ef633d15ed780595294dc2d80e1009,"Ben Affleck today finally admitted the name of the slave ancestor he had censored from his past. The Oscar-winning actor posted on social media that a 'Benjamin Cole' of Georgia, an ancestor on his mother's side, was the relative dropped from the PBS show about his family history. The admission came the day after he apologized for lobbying for the removal of the truth about his family past from Finding Your Roots. Writing on his personal account he said: 'Lots of people have been asking who the guy was. His name was Benjamin Cole - lived in Georgia on my Mom's side about six generations back.' Scroll down for video . Ben Affleck has apologized after he demanded information about a slave-owning relative be withheld from a PBS show about his ancestry . Admission: How Ben Affleck finally came clean . Affleck took to Facebook to issue his apology . Close: Ben Affleck and his former Freedom Rider mother Chris Anne, seen last October in Los Angeles . His mother, Chris Anne, had featured in the show, not because her ancestor benefited from indenture, but because she had been a Freedom Rider. After appearing on Finding Your Roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner, Affleck pushed the network to leave that information out of the program it was first revealed by DailyMail Online, a request the producers ultimately agreed to. However, the admission suggests Affleck may have more than one slave-owning ancestor. Another was named today by The Sun as James McGuire, who kept eight slaves on his farm in what is now Trenton in New Jersey in the 1840s. The affair has severely embarrassed the actor, a high-profile campaigner for liberal causes, who runs a charity for Africa. It has also plunged PBS into crisis, and according to a prominent commentator, 'diminished' Prof Henry Louis Gates Jr, the host of the show, who is a Harvard academic. Last night the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on Facebook, while also explaining his reasons for his decision. 'After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for Finding Your Roots, it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves,' wrote Affleck. 'I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth.' Affleck went on to say he lobbied for that information to be withheld after filming the episode. 'It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable,' he explained. 'The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family.' He then added; 'I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story. We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing.' Spotlight: The future of Prof Henry Louis Gates Jr as the host of the show is in the balance after PBS launched an investigation into whether its editorial code was breached. US genealogist Debra Fleming is said to have helped trace Affleck's family tree back to McGuire, a relative of his father Timothy. Ms Fleming told the Sun: 'There are lots of farmers in the family. Slavery didn't end in New Jersey until 1846.' Affleck is just one of the many celebrities once again under fire after WikiLeaks sorted all the hacked Sony emails into a system that makes them easier for the public to search. PBS meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network's editorial standards. They have yet to release a statement on their findings or to make clear when they will be reported, and whether they will quiz Affleck. However, the affair has also called into question the future of the show's host, Prof Henry Louis Gates Jr. After an exhaustive search of my ancestry for 'Finding Your Roots,' it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves. I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth. Skip decided what went into the show. I lobbied him the same way I lobby directors about what takes of mine I think they should use. This is the collaborative creative process. Skip agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with. In the end, it's his show and I knew that going in. I'm proud to be his friend and proud to have participated. It's important to remember that this isn't a news program. Finding Your Roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family, making you quite vulnerable. The assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family. I regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story. We deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are, as a nation, still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery. It is an examination well worth continuing. I am glad that my story, however indirectly, will contribute to that discussion. While I don't like that the guy is an ancestor, I am happy that aspect of our country's history is being talked about. Ben Affleck . Until now he had been a Harvard University academic best known for the 'beer summit' organized by President Obama when a policeman tried to arrest him because of a 911 call about men breaking and entering a home - which was in fact Prof Gates' own home. The arrest became the center of a debate on racial profiling, and the African-American academic and the policeman were invited to the White House to discuss the arrest and its fallout over a beer. However today he was described as 'diminished' in the New York Times by Frank Bruni, its columnist, as 'diminished' by the affair which 'exposed Gates, a trusted authority on the African-American experience, to accusations that he'd sold out'. PBS declined today to offer any guarantees that he would remain host of the show. On Friday it issued a statement on his behalf but today said it was not responsible for his public statements. The publicly-funded broadcaster was severely criticized by its ombudsman for its handling of Affleck and Daily Mail Online's revelations. Michael Getler, the ombudsman, said the channel 'took a beating'. 'On the broader points, it seems to me that any serious program about genealogy, especially dealing with celebrities, cannot leave out a slave-owning ancestor,' he said. '...Gates, aside from the decision he made – and it looks to me like a bad one – also, in my opinion, violated the well-known ""no surprises doctrine"" for public affairs programming and many other things by not informing PBS about these demands by Affleck'. He added: 'As for PBS, they just struck me as asleep at the switch when this broke. It was pretty apparent from the leaked emails what had happened and to put out a statement that said essentially nothing and very quickly looked pathetic, as if they were hiding something.' PBS said it had no comment to make on the ombudsman's words.","Ben Affleck has revealed name of the slave-owning ancestor which he got PBS to cut from Finding My Roots .

The tweet, a pun on the name of the famous home end at Liverpool Football Club, alluded to recent controversial incidents in the United States in which unarmed African-American men have been killed by police. Paddy Power -- well-known for its use of publicity stunts -- used it to link to a piece showing statistics for games between Liverpool and Newcastle United ahead of their English Premier League match on Monday. A Paddy Power spokesman told CNN before Liverpool's 2-0 victory at Anfield: ""It was a joke, and no offense was meant."" The tweet has since been deleted, but its removal -- along with the statement -- did little to placate social media users who condemned the organization, with some calling for the person who wrote the tweet to be sacked. In January, Paddy Power attracted headlines after backing David Ginola's failed candidacy for the presidency of world football's governing body. The former Paris Saint-Germain and Tottenham player could not persuade enough FIFA football associations to back his bid. He needed five to have any chance of unseating Sepp Blatter. Paddy Power started the funding for the candidacy, but its penchant for publicity stunts quickly led many people to dismiss Ginola's bid as another attempt to grab headlines. Paddy Power, the son of one the company's founders and its marketing spokesman, explained: ""We've been known for some mischievous activity around the world. This is not that. This is for real."" Last year, the company generated anger when it promised ""money back if he walks"" in relation to the trial of disgraced South African Paralympian Oscar Pistorius. Monday's win put Liverpool fifth in the table, four points behind defending champion Manchester City, which holds England's final European Champions League qualification spot with six games left to play this season. Young England forward Raheem Sterling, who has turned down a new contract, scored a fine solo goal in the first half, and midfielder Joe Allen's 70th-minute strike condemned 13th-placed Newcastle to a fifth successive league defeat.

Authorities said the body of the ten-year-old was found on Saturday around 1pm by searchers from a Boy Scout troop - about ten feet from the river's edge in Brooklyn Center. Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that shows the boy's father, Pierre Collins, 33, was in that area at the time the boy disappeared. However, she did not elaborate on the nature of that evidence. Police said on Sunday that the boy's father is a primary suspect as the case becomes a homicide investigation. A body pulled from the Mississippi River on Saturday has been identified as Barway Edward Collins (above), 10, who has been missing for nearly a month . Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that reveals that the boy's father, Pierre Collins, was in that area at the time he disappeared (above Revering during a news conference on April 12, 2015 in Crystal, Minnesota) Barway's father, 33-year-old Pierre Collins (pictured left as he stands with his wife, Yamah, during a vigil held for his son last month) is a primary suspect in the homicide investigation involving his son . 'This location is consistent with our knowledge of Pierre Collin's activities on March 18 and he remains a primary suspect,' said Revering. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated. The case is being considered a homicide based on the autopsy and information from the medical examiner, said Revering. A report last month by Fox 9 said that according to sources, Pierre Collins, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing. The boy's father, who has said he is innocent, has not been arrested or charged in relation to the incident, but Revering said authorities have his passport to ensure he stays in the country. Police were stationed at his apartment complex for his own protection after reports of death threats. On Sunday, Pastor Harding Smith, of the Spiritual Church of God who has been acting as the family's spokesman said when the family received the news, there were a lot of tears, according to Twin Cities. 'There were lots of tears and lots of screams,' he said. 'There was disbelief, hurt, sadness. There is a deep sense of loss when you enter that home.' Alexander Collins, executive director of the Liberian Ministry Association, said: 'We also want to make clear to the perpetrator of this tragedy, that wherever you are, you will be found. This evil will be found. 'Wherever you are hiding, under a car, underground, make no mistake our community does not abide this evil.' The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated . Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. In video released by police (scenes from footage above), Barway says 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle' In a March 25 interview with the Star Tribune, Pierre Collins said he was not home when his son disappeared and he was upset to be considered a suspect. 'I've been working with the police just to bring my son home,' he told the newspaper. 'I will do whatever they want just so Barway can come home. I have nothing to do with Barway's missing.' His wife and Barway's stepmother, Yamah Collins, also said she and her husband did not know who took the boy, and they pleaded for his safe return. Pierre Collins (right), accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith (center), the family's spokesman, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last month, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional . Police said on Sunday that the boy's father (above) is a 'primary suspect' as the case becomes a homicide investigation . Police released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 'The father and the party described as an 'uncle' are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway's father has not been completely truthful with us.' Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.' When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was 'very emotional' during the test. 'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school (above a massive billboard featuring a missing ad for Barway) Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Video surveillance from his apartment complex shows he was about to go inside, but then turned around as if he was called over to the parking lot by someone he knew, and he walked away, police said last month.

The family told the Star Tribune that Barway emigrated from his home country of Liberia, where his mother lives, to stay with his father in 2011. The father said he wanted 'to make him better' and for Barway to eventually go to college. While looking for Barway, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies searched the area with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses.","Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minnesota apartment complex March 18 after school .

7188,925d032d5e2592d986cddc6d909a0b6ccd9cc361,"The acting chief executive of the Clinton Foundation acknowledged that the global philanthropy made mistakes in how it disclosed its donors amid growing scrutiny as Hillary Rodham Clinton opens her presidential campaign. The fund had been facing allegations of improper behavior after reports surfaced about undisclosed donations from foreign governments and a donor who was selling his uranium company to a Russian state agency at the same time the State Department had to approve the sale. Acting CEO Maura Pally defended the foundation's work and reaffirmed its commitment to transparency, describing its policies on donor disclosure and contributions from foreign governments as 'stronger than ever.' However, the tempered apology came the same day that a government watchdog said that the charity seemed like a 'slush fund' for one of America's most powerful political families. The acting CEO of the Clinton Foundation apologized after Hillary Clinton's presidential candidacy put it under intense scrutiny for undisclosed donations. Above, Clinton speaks at a foundation event in December . Maura Pally (left) said that money received from a businessman when he was seeking State Department approval for selling his company to Russia (right) could not be disclosed under Canadian law . Pally said the foundation expected to refile some of its tax forms, following a voluntary external review, because it had 'mistakenly combined' government grants and donations. She said the foundation would 'remedy' any errors but stressed the total revenue was reported accurately and that grants were properly broken out on audited statements on its website. 'Yes, we made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them, and have taken steps to ensure they don't happen in the future,' she said. Pally also described the foundation's work with the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, which she said received funding from a separate organization in Canada. The partnership received more than $2million in donations from the Canadian chairman of Uranium One, Ian Telfer, when it was being sold to Russian state atomic agency Rosatom. Telfer's donations, given by his own foundation, came at the same time as the State Department, then headed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, helped approve the sale. The transaction, which followed Bill Clinton helping businessman Frank Giustra secure some of the Kazakh uranium sites also being sold, needed to be vetted by a government committee because it gave one-fifth of US uranium production into foreign hands. Pally's blog post said that the Giustra partnership does not disclose its donors because under Canadian law they are not disclosed without prior permission from each donor. 'This is hardly an effort on our part to avoid transparency,' she said. The apology said that Uranium One Chairman Ian Telfer's donations to a foundation partnership with Frank Giustra (right) would have needed prior permission to be disclosed. Above, Giustra and Bill Clinton . A non-profit rating agency has placed the Clinton Foundation on a watch list. Above, the New York Times's David Leonhardt (left), philanthropist Melinda Gates (center) and Hillary Clinton . Despite the apology, a fellow at the nonpartisan government watchdog Sunlight Foundation questioned the foundation and the Clintons' association with it, according to the New York Post. 'It seems like the Clinton Foundation operates as a slush fund for the Clintons,' Sunlight's Bill Allison said. The Clinton Foundation is said to have taken more than $140million in grants and pledges in 2013, spending $84.6 million on 'functional expenses' including payroll and just $9million on direct aid. The foundation, which was also placed on a watch list by the non-profit rating organization Charity Navigator, said that the excess money is in pledges rather than hard assets. Though the rating organization said it 'takes no position on allegations made or issues raised by third parties' it said on its website that it 'has determined that the nature of this/these issue(s) warrants highlighting the information available so that donors are aware of the issues in question'. Charity Navigator also refused to rate the foundation, citing insufficient methods to gauge its 'atypical business model'. Since announcing her run for president, Clinton has sought to dismiss questions about financial support of her family charity and allegations of undue influence as 'distractions and attacks' by Republicans seeking to discredit her. Pally said 'So yes, we made mistakes, as many organizations of our size do, but we are acting quickly to remedy them, and have taken steps to ensure they don't happen in the future'. The philanthropy was started in 2001 by former President Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea will be starting a nine-day trip to Africa on Wednesday to highlight the group's work on issues such as economic growth and empowerment, climate change and empowering women and girls.","Acting Clinton Foundation CEO Maura Pally said 'Yes, we made mistakes'

6292,ea13b295951d0f9e26c194db89ef0f30440dd1b0,"Chelsea were made to work hard for their three points against Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but Eden Hazard starred for Jose Mourinho's team. He slotted Chelsea ahead in typically composed fashion from the penalty spot before Charlie Adam equalised with an astonishing strike from inside his own half shortly before half time. Stoke continued to make things difficult for Chelsea until an Asmir Begovic error led to Loic Remy tapping in the winner. Here, Sportsmail's Kieran Gill gives his player ratings. CHELSEA (4-2-3-1) Thibaut Courtois – 5.5 . Never called into action in the opening 43 minutes but beaten by Adam with an incredible strike from inside Stoke’s half. Too far off his line and one of the world’s best goalkeepers was left embarrassed. Thibaut Courtois was on the winning team but will want to forget  Charlie Adam beating him from his own half . Gary Cahill (left) and John Terry leap up to block an attempt at goal from Stoke's Philipp Wollscheid . Branislav Ivanovic – 6.5 . Tidied up well on the rare occasion Stoke threatened. Played with more freedom once Chelsea had the lead and tried to help in attack down the wing. Gary Cahill – 6 .5 . Looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as Stoke tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half. John Terry – 7 . Manned the back well and it took a goal-of-the-season contender for his team to concede against a Stoke side that ran out of ideas at times. Always the man that remained at the back to kill off any threat. Cesar Azpilicueta – 6.5 . Tried to get forward and help Hazard down the left. Closed down well and put in a tireless performance. Nemanja Matic – 6 . A few too many misplaced passes and a hurried clearance almost spelled danger for Chelsea. Cleaned up well when needed to win back possession, however. Cesc Fabregas – 7 . Won the penalty with a clever cut back that fooled Wollscheid. Kept the midfield ticking over well. Brazil international Willian (left) also produced an impressive display for Chelsea in the win over Stoke . Eden Hazard put Chelsea into the lead with from the penalty spot in the first half . Diego Costa's (right) game was curtailed 10 minutes after coming on with what looked like a hamstring injury . Willian – 7.5 . A handful for Stoke as he, Oscar and Hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half, though they were never taken. Never short of a run. Oscar – 6.5 . Scuppered one of Chelsea’s best chances to take the lead by placing his shot wide of the far post, and was ultimately – and unfortunately – sacrificed for Costa at half time. Eden Hazard – 8.5 . A live wire. Master of the one-two and creating chances. Ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give Chelsea a much-needed lead before Adam’s equaliser. Didn’t look tired, despite his weariness during international break. Assisted the winning goal. Loic Remy - 7.5 . Looked a worthy replacement for Costa as he twice went close to giving Chelsea the lead in the opening seven minutes. Scored in the second half when Mourinho really needed it, and it was deserved. Loic Remy (left) slots in Chelsea's winner against Stoke in the second half at Stamford Bridge . SUBS: . Diego Costa – 6 . Came on but could do no damage as he was forced off with what looked like another hamstring injury. Immediately called to the bench for him to come off after 10 minutes on the field. Didier Drogba – 6 . Replaced Costa after the striker went off with an injury. Had little to do but hold up the ball. Juan Cuadrado – 6 . Little to do but helped Chelsea get over the line. MANAGER: Jose Mourinho – 6.5 . A frustrating afternoon for Mourinho, who was active on the touchline throughout, looking unhappy and muttering to himself. Either way, it worked, and his team added three points to their title charge. Jose Mourinho was active throughout the game on the touchline as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 . STOKE CITY (4-4-2) Asmir Begovic – 6.5 . Outstanding one-handed save at full stretch to deny Remy’s deflected shot after less than three minutes. Ultimately took a penalty for Begovic to concede the first. He’d done his homework, going the same way Hazard normally does, but beaten at the other side. His throw was intercepted by Willian which led to Chelsea's winner, though. Geoff Cameron – 5.5 . Given the unwanted task of stopping Hazard on his runs down the left wing on occasion. Ryan Shawcross – 6 . Stayed physical throughout, as per. Captained his team well on a ground that has been unkind to them previously, but ultimately could not help them steal a point. Philipp Wollscheid – 5.5 . Took the bait from Fabregas by sweeping the Spaniard’s feet to give Chelsea a penalty and ultimately the lead. Ryan Shawcross (right) led Stoke well but could not help his side take a point at Stamford Bridge . Wollscheid (right) slides in on Cesc Fabregas to concede a penalty in the first half, from which Hazard scored . Marc Wilson – 5.5 . A little unsure at times, largely down to a lack of communication between him and his team-mates. Stephen Ireland – 6 . Strong in midfield but found it difficult to get involved as that area was dominated by the men in blue. Glenn Whelan – 5.5 . Rightly booked for a late challenge on Fabregas but did not see much of the ball as Chelsea dominated midfield. Steven Nzonzi – 6 . Close with a controlled shot after a poor clearance by Matic and again in the second half as he grazed the far post with a bouncing effort across goal. Could not take the few chances that fell his way. Steven Nzonzi (centre) went close to scoring for Stoke but ultimately did not impose himself on the game . Charlie Adam (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike levelled the scores . Charlie Adam – 6.5 . Take a bow, Charlie Adam. Incredible goal as he channelled his inner David Beckham and, noticing Courtois off his line, scored from in his own half. A little anonymous until that moment, but his faults were obliterated with that 66-yard strike. Jonathan Walters – 5.5 . Little joy as Stoke rarely threatened up top but tried to keep them in with a shot and held the ball well on occasion. Closely marked by Terry throughout. Mame Biram Diouf – 5.5 . Failed to make an impact and was substituted after 62 minutes for Arnautovic. Jonathan Walters (left) had little joy for Stoke against Chelsea on Saturday, despite his hard work . Mame Biram Diouf (left) floundered against Chelsea's stern defence at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . SUBS: . Arnautovic – 6 . Too little too late to have an influence. MANAGER: Mark Hughes 5.5 . His team were constantly on the backfoot. REFEREE: Jonathan Moss 6 . Correct decision with the penalty. Not many controversial decisions to make aside from that, but had to be strict with bookings .","Eden Hazard and Loic Remy hit the net as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 .

Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury . It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training .a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries . Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic. He saw assistant Steve Thompson lose his job without warning on April 2 and his own deal, which expires at the end of the season, looks increasingly unlikely to be renewed under the club's current regime. Cellino is currently banned after being being found guilty of not paying tax on a yacht in Italy. He has been banned from holding any influence over the club since the end of January and is set to return in a fortnight's time. Leeds were not available for comment.","Leeds United travel to Charlton Athletic on Saturday in the Championship .

The neurosurgeon, who is in Kathmandu to cover the aftermath of Saturday's deadly earthquake, performed a craniotomy on the 15-year-old girl, Sandhya Chalise, after a wall of her family's home fell on her as she collected water outside. Sandhya, who lives in a more remote area of the country, only reached Kathmandu's Bir Hospital two days after the 7.8-magnitude quake and by that point, blood had collected in the top of her brain, CNN reported. Scroll down for video . Put to work: Dr Sanjay Gupta (second left), the chief medical correspondent for CNN, was asked by a Nepalese hospital to perform brain surgery on a 15-year-girl who was injured in the earthquake . Quick-thinking: Gupta, center at the hospital, said the girl was just one of many people walking through the doors with head injuries at the overstretched hospital. More than 6,000 people were injured . 'I was asked to do this by the doctors there at the hospital,' Dr Gupta said during a telephone interview with the network. 'I think they literally need another set of hands because the demand is so high.' During the procedure, he was forced to used basic equipment, such as a saw rather than an electric drill, and sterile water and iodine from a bottle, rather than a proper scrub sink, he told CNN. Following the operation, she is 'doing well', Gupta said, 'but her story is unfortunately very typical'. After the surgery, an eight-year-old girl arrived at the hospital needing a similar operation. More than 4,300 people are believed to have been killed in the earthquake, but Nepalese officials have speculated that as many as 10,000 could have died. Around 6,000 have been injured and are pouring into the hospitals, which are struggling to keep up with the demand. 'I've seen a lot of situations around the world, and this is as bad as I've ever seen it,' Gupta said. Hurt: Another child with a similar head injury, pictured, came to the hospital shortly after the operation . Helping hand: As well as working for CNN, Gupta is a neurosurgeon at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta . 'They need more resources, they need more personnel here right now, and they're expecting many more patients as these rescue operations go on. They're barely able to keep up right now.' As well as serving as CNN's chief medical correspondent, Gupta is a neurosurgeon at Emory Healthcare in Atlanta. It is not the first time the married father-of-three, 45, has performed surgery while on a reporting job. In 2003, while covering the medical demands of the invasion of Iraq, he performed emergency surgery on U.S. soldiers and Iraqi civilians. And while reporting in Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, he and other doctors removed a piece of concrete from a 12-year-old girl's skull aboard aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson.

Here is a look back at some of the finest examples of the genre. Charlie Adam struck a stunning goal from inside his own half against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . Thibaut Courtois was left helpless also his Chelsea side eventually went on to win 2-1 . DAVID BECKHAM . The midfielder would go on to be a world-renowned, generational talent - but was only an emerging figure when, on the first day of the 1996-97 season, he spotted Wimbledon goalkeeper Neil Sullivan off his line and arced the ball perfectly over him and into the net to round off a 3-0 win. David Beckham struck from inside his own half for Manchester United against Wimbledon in 1996 . Beckham celebrated the final goal in 3-0 win for United on the opening day of the 1996-97 season . JONE SAMUELSEN . An even greater rarity - a headed goal from a player in his own half. Samuelsen's Odd Grenland side were leading 2-1, Tromso's goalkeeper Andre Hansen was up for a corner and the ball was cleared towards Odd's centre forward. Defender Steffen Hagen nodded the ball away from him and just back across the halfway line, where Samuelsen met it with a powerful header which carried at least 30 yards and bounced into the unguarded net. Local police measured the goal at 58.13 metres, earning Samuelsen a spot in the Guinness Book of Records for the longest headed goal. XABI ALONSO . The Spanish midfielder actually achieved the feat twice in 2006 while with Liverpool - and once with each foot, for good measure. The left-footed effort was into an empty net, with Luton keeper Marlon Beresford up for a corner in injury time of an FA Cup tie the Reds won 5-3, but he then launched a flat lob over Newcastle keeper Steve Harper from the edge of the centre circle inside his own half in the Premier League. Xabi Alonso celebrates scoring from his own half for Liverpool against Newcastle in 2006 . Steve Harper was helplessly beaten in the Newcastle goal by the Spanish midfielder's superb effort . STEFAN ISHIZAKI . The Elfsborg forward was out on the right sideline, a couple of yards inside his own half, when Orebro keeper Tomer Chencinski's clearance dropped to him. Ishizaki simply swung a first-time right foot volley at the ball, which bounced once in the middle of the penalty area before finding the top corner perfectly. MAYNOR FIGUEROA . The then-Wigan defender displayed great quick thinking against Stoke in 2009 when his side were awarded a free-kick near the halfway line. Robert Huth fouled Scott Sinclair and, with most of the players napping, Figueroa ran straight on to the stationary ball to blaze a shot over Thomas Sorensen and in. Wigan Athletic's Maynor Figueroa (second left) struck from behind halfway against Stoke in 2009 . MORITZ STOPPELKAMP . Again, the Hannover goalkeeper was up for a free-kick, but that should not detract from Paderborn midfielder Stoppelkamp's achievement as the ball was cleared to him on the edge of his own penalty area and he simply controlled it on his chest, turned and volleyed the ball into the net from a scarcely believable 83 yards to make it 2-0. Moritz Stoppelkamp of Paderborn (centre) celebrates his stunning goal against Hanover in September 2014 . CHARLIE ADAM . The Stoke man has previous for this kind of behaviour, having showcased the skill during two loan spells from Rangers earlier in his career. An effort for Blackpool's reserves was just inside the Accrington half, but one for Ross County against St Mirren in 2007 was just about on the line - close enough to give him the benefit of the doubt, in any case.

Indian doctors at Kathmandu’s Bir Hospital told Mail Today that packets of ‘beef masala’ were sent by Pakistan on Tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors. These doctors – drawn from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) — are members of a 34-member medical team sent to Nepal for treating the survivors. “When we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of ‘beef masala’. There were other food items too,” Dr Balwinder Singh told Mail Today. Perplexed, the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead. “We did not touch the Pakistani aid,” Dr Singh said. “Most of the local people are not aware of the contents. When they understand, they avoid it,” said another doctor on the condition of anonymity. He added: “Pakistan has hurt Nepal’s religious sentiments by supplying the masala. Shockingly, it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter.” Pakistani soldiers load relief supplies for Nepal . Exclusive photographs of the ‘beef masala’ packets supplied to Nepal are with Mail Today. These pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was Nowshera Cantt in Pakistan. These packets also prominently mention that these are not for sale and the contents include ‘potato bhujia’ and ‘beef masala’. A top Nepal government official said: “The matter has been conveyed to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and the intelligence chief. We are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts. If the report is correct, we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with Pakistan. India, being our key partner, will also be informed of the developments.” Tasneem Aslam, spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs, told Mail Today: “I am not aware of the issue…I am not responsible for the dispatch. The relief aid is sent by the National Disaster Management Authority.” Nepalese soldiers stand next to wrecked buildings at Durbar Square . A press note uploaded on the website of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Pakistan (http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/), states: “(The) National Disaster Management Authority has dispatched the second of two sorties of C-130 aircrafts on April 28 in collaboration with Pakistan Army, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Pakistan Air Force. The relief goods include 250 tents, 200 food packs (2.6 tonne), 1,000 Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), 1,000 blankets and 33 cartons of medicines. These relief goods have been provided from NDMA stocks….” Despite repeated attempts, the officials of the Pakistan NDMA could not be contacted. The food items have been manufactured by PANA Force Foods. The consignment was supplied after receiving orders from Pakistan’s NDMA. “PANA Force food processing centre aims at providing quality goods at affordable prices. Currently, the company is supplying two brands of products to Pakistan Army commonly known as Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) and Emergency Pack Ration (EP Ration or high-energy biscuits) whereas a plant for the production of dehydrated vegetables and fruits is under construction,” the official website of PANA Force Foods mentions. The website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities, like earthquakes and floods. According to Hindu belief, eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one’s mother. In Nepal — for long the world’s only Hindu state — the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender. The first Civil Code of Nepal, the Muluki Ain of 1854, stated: “This kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows, women, and Brahmins may not be killed.” It trumpeted Nepal as the ‘purest Hindu kingdom’ and simultaneously signaled to Nepalese citizens that Hindu religious creeds would be the law of the land. But an amendment in 1990 to the Civil Code made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison. Delhi High Court raises alarm over illegal buildings . By Mail Today in New Delhi . Municipal authorities in Delhi received a rap from the Delhi High Court on Wednesday over the numerous illegal buildings across the city. Days after the killer earthquake in Nepal, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said unauthorised constructions and colonies in the city are disasters waiting to happen. A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that if an earthquake hits Delhi like the one in Nepal, all the unauthorised buildings constructed without following regulations, will crumble. It also said each government has been extending the date till which illegal constructions are protected from punitive action as it is looking for votes. “If people die, then who will vote?” the court asked. “They are disasters waiting to happen. Are you (municipal corporations) taking strict action? Are you coming out with an action plan?” the bench questioned while hearing a batch of petitions on unauthorised constructions in the city. In response, the civic agency said it was coming out with an action plan. The court, thereafter, said it will take up the matter of seismic viability of structures in the national Capital in some other appropriate matter. UK aid team in security breach at Delhi airport . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . It has come to light that a rescue team which arrived from the United Kingdom on Monday for operations in earthquake-hit Nepal, violated the safety norms of the Delhi IGI Airport. The team allegedly waited in front of an aircraft at the ‘apron area’ of the airport for about six hours before they could fly to Kathmandu. According to the members of the British rescue team, after waiting for all those hours, they were accommodated in a flight of the Spanish Air Force. Members of the British rescue team headed to Nepal posted photos of themselves waiting at IGI Airport on Twitter . According to a senior civil aviation official, it was a case of gross violation of safety rules. The DGCA can take action against the agencies that were responsible for the violation. “DGCA had earlier punished various airlines for committing such a violation. This particular British team had dogs with them and they were in front of the aircraft for six hours. It’s scary,” a senior DGCA official said after seeing the photographs of the group that were posted by a rescue team member on Twitter. An immigration official said the British group comprised 15-20 personnel from the UK Fire and Rescue team. They reached Delhi IGI Airport around 5.30pm on Monday. But due to weather and other clearance issues, they were asked to wait at the airport. “The team didn’t have proper clearances. India keeps a watch on every unit and aircraft flying to Kathmandu through Delhi. Airport officials asked them to wait but instead of going to the terminal building, these rescue team members waited in front of the nosewheel of an aircraft,” a senior airport official told Mail Today. Later, when the Indian agencies told them that the weather in Kathmandu was not favourable and it was packed with aircraft, the British rescue team members arranged their materials on their own, the official said. After almost an hour they managed to convince the Spanish Air Force officials, who agreed to fly these British rescue team members to Kathmandu. “Even then, the rescue team members didn’t go inside the airport. No security official asked them to move from there. They remained there for more than three hours,” a senior immigration official said. “They had equipment which needed to be checked by various agencies. Also, they didn’t take proper permission due to which they were asked to wait. But, they ignored all security rules and stayed there in front of an aircraft,” a senior airport official said. According to a senior official of the ministry of civil aviation: “No one is allowed to wait in front of an aircraft. Even the passengers are not allowed to put their baggage near to the plane.” The team reportedly left Delhi around 12 midnight and reached Kathmandu around 2am.","Cows are treated as sacred in Nepal, where the majority are Hindus .

I’ve always had a love affair with Thailand. At the end of filming Channel 4’s Indian Summers last year, I headed to Koh Phangan, an island off Ko Samui, and did a week-long meditation and yoga course. I came away convinced I was going to carry on doing a minimum of 30 minutes of meditation every morning in London – a resolve that was slowly eroded by the stresses of relying on London Underground and from Sunday hangovers. So I jumped at the chance of heading out to Thailand again before the start of filming series two. Despite an 18-hour journey on the flawless Singapore Airlines, I arrived in Phuket still excited about recapturing my zen. Phuket, however, is very different from Koh Phangan. First of all it is much greener, and secondly it is definitely an island with party in its bones. I was staying at the luxurious Sri Panwa resort, which comprises a series of minimalist villas complete with surround-sound systems pumping out Enya, and each with their own saltwater private infinity pool facing out on to the shimmering Andaman Sea. Villa co-ordinator Pim immediately apologised for the increased security around the resort (a Thai princess and Liam from One Direction were there). I’m sure you can just sit and chill in the hotel’s beautiful restaurants or sunbathe on your private terrace, but when Pim dropped me off at my villa, she revealed that another famous Sri Panwa guest – DJ Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim) – was performing at a nightclub called Seduction that evening. I decided zen could wait. Seduction turned out to be off Bangla Road, the heart of Phuket’s red-light district. Having grabbed a tuk-tuk from outside the hotel (complete with strings of fluorescent lights and speakers blaring out Taylor Swift’s Blank Space), I arrived at Patong Beach itself. This is the strip is where zen goes to die. Olivia did yoga at Sri Panwa’s Cool Spa, on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa (pictured) Bangla Road in Phuket comes to life when the sun goes down. The road is shut to cars and becomes 1,312ft of neon lights, loud music and cheap beer . There are Thai versions of cabaret clubs such as Crazy Horse and Moulin Rouge, while street hawkers sold tickets to ‘ping-pong shows’, which I later discovered were not as innocent as they sounded. Pim ushered me up an escalator to Seduction’s rooftop party venue. Norman had just started his set and was whipping up a good-looking Thai crowd, all of whom seemed as if they were probably doing an MA at Central Saint Martins in London, into a frenzy. The odd British tourist was in there too, looking appropriately smug that they had stumbled into this stylish haven and escaped the booming sex trade below. The wife of one of the owners of Sri Panwa turned to me and whispered that everyone inside the club was ‘VVIP’. Content in this knowledge, I continued my very English head-bob to Norman’s hit song Praise You. The next morning, breakfast at Baba, Sri Panwa’s poolside restaurant, was a glorious affair. I faced my greatest challenge so far… selecting from the breakfast buffet. Room with a view! The luxurious Sri Panwa resort in Phuket features an infinity pool overlooking the Andaman Sea . I always get a bit nervous at buffets. It has to be a carefully managed procedure, and with only a certain amount of space and a plethora of choice, I did an almost ridiculous amount of hovering before settling on a rather ad hoc selection of banana pancakes followed by a Thai fish curry. Curious but excellent is the only way I can describe this combination. It is also testimony to the hotel that all the staff seemed so happy there. I caught a couple of them making faces while squirting the pancake mixture on to the griddle and giggling with a joyousness that I can’t really imagine at a breakfast buffet in London. I whiled away the afternoon reading by my infinity pool, slathering on the factor 50 at every opportunity, as my skin needs to be eased into even the most minimal sun exposure unless I want that a tantalising combination of prickly heat and sunburn. The James Bond Island is a popular feature in Phang Nga Bay, Phuket . I then headed up to Sri Panwa’s Cool Spa, where you can practise yoga on a breathtaking platform called Baba Nest, which offers 360 degree views of Cape Panwa. Our Thai yoga instructor, who coincidentally had a body which looked as if it had been carved out of mahogany, performed the chaturanga at sunset with a sinuousness that reminded me of that scene featuring the yoga instructor from Couples Retreat, for anyone who knows that film. He didn’t quite slap me on the bottom and say ‘Encouragement’, but it was a close-run thing. Then, after a fabulous dinner at Sri Panwa’s beautifully appointed Thai restaurant Soul Food, where the ‘squid on hot plate’ sizzled satisfactorily and the green curry with prawns was to die for, I submitted to the jet-lag and crashed out on pillows on which the maids had placed a shell and an orchid. Returning to my quest for zen the next morning, I headed north of Phuket and took a 30-minute boat ride to a quiet island in Phang Nga Bay, which I had been advised was much less touristy than the Phi Phi islands made famous by the film adaptation of Alex Garland’s The Beach. I was picked up by the staff of the Six Senses Yao Noi hotel and spa who had lined the bamboo pier, and was driven to the complex by a tuk-tuk, which bore no resemblance whatsoever to the ones in Phuket. DJ Hardwell also known as Fat Boy Slim,  performs a set. The DJ also stayed at the Sri Panwa and performed at a nightclub called seduction . The hotel is much more of a retreat than Sri Panwa and puts a lot of emphasis on being an eco-friendly, sustainable resort. The landscaped gardens are supposedly ‘edible’, there’s a space for some of the happiest free-range chickens I’ve ever seen, and a mushroom hut, where the chef harvests fresh oyster mushrooms. But this resort is also beautiful. Each of the villas contains a double bed with white mosquito nets hanging from interwoven horns, the bathrooms have beautiful copper standalone basins, and from the sunken bath there are exquisite views of the strange islets of Phang Nga Bay. The wooden decking leads to a private pool, but you can also pad down to the private sandy beach which stretches below and go for a swim. Fruit and drinks by the pool at Evason Six Senses Hideaway on Koh Yao Noi island . I ate poached rock lobster in coconut milk, lemongrass, galangal and kaffir lime, and a beef curry on jasmine rice, at Six Senses’ beautiful Hilltop restaurant before heading to the beach again where the hotel was screening the Hollywood classic Breakfast At Tiffany’s under the stars. As I listened to Audrey Hepburn describe Tiffany, I thought that this hotel also was a great place to head to when you had the ‘mean reds’ – nothing very bad could happen to you here. Back at Sri Panwa and there was just enough time to indulge in one more Asian-style breakfast curry before take-off. I also spotted Norman lounging by his pool, so I wandered over to congratulate him on his set a few nights before. Norman merely shrugged, as if the crazed hero-worship in the club was just a run-of-the-mill Tuesday, so I duly toned down my enthusiasm and sauntered off with the look of ‘Yeah, totally, I feel you. It’s a normal Tuesday night in Phuket for me too.’ And then it was back to London. I may have mislaid my zen in Phuket but I sure had partied. Indian Summers is out now on DVD.

1457,18200c0699a63fc3f3d75b491caa9ef3b9428e57,"An Ohio woman was shocked this month when an officer cited her for leaving her dog in a hot car but, instead of writing a ticket, the cop forced her to sit inside to see how it feels. The Strongsville pet owner was inside a Walmart as the dog sat in the parking lot. The officer then had the woman sit inside with the windows up and ignition off. And this isn't the first time an animal-loving officer has employed the unorthodox punishment. In the recent Ohio incident, the woman was left 'looking uncomfortable' as she sat in her unventilated Nissan Sentra, but drove away with just a warning and her tail between her legs. Scroll down for video . Unorthodox: A cop ordered a woman in this Ohio shopping center to sit in her hot car this month after officers discovered her dog locked inside her Nissan Sentra as she shopped in Walmart . In Truth or Consequences, New Mexico last June, the pet owner in question wasn't as eager to put the incident behind her. Shelly Nicholas filed a report against an officer who told her to sit in her car after someone called to report a dog was inside with no ventilation in 90 degree heat. Nicholas reasoned that she'd only been away ten minutes. 'You can wait in the truck and close the door you know, since it's not that hot,' the officer is heard saying to Nicholas in body camera footage later obtained by KOB. However, in her report, Nicholas characterizes the officers words as an 'order' and the footage does not show her actually sitting in the hot car as police wrote her a ticket. Sweating it out: Last year, Shelly Nicholas in Truth or Consequences, New Mexico was told to sit in her hot car after her dog was found locked inside with no ventilation. She filed a report against the officers, but body cam footage later revealed it was more of a request than an order . Declined to do it: Nicholas declined to sit in the the hot car with the door closed in spite of the officer's request . While this may not be a legitimate police practice, officers have reason for concern in these situations, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. While Nicholas argued she'd only been gone 10 minutes, the AVMA says that temperatures can rise 20F inside a car in that short amount of time. In 20 minutes, the temperature can rise by nearly 30 degrees. Even on a 70F day, writes the AVMA, the interior of a car can reach 110F after one hour. Even short periods in such heat can cause heat stroke and irreversible organ damage in your dog. h/t Huffington Post .","A woman at an Ohio Walmart says an officer forced her to sit in her car after she left her dog sitting in the parking lot April 12 .

Little Jiaojiao only survived because rain canopies, laundry racks and wet grass broke her fall in Zheng Du City, Central China. Her mother, Zheng Jiayu, 31, who left Jiaojiao at home on her own, now cannot afford the huge £100,000 medical bill, according to People's Online Daily. Survivor: Little Jiaojiao pictured in hospital after falling from a 150ft from a window while her mother was out . Jiaojiao (pictured here before the accident) only survived because rain canopies, laundry racks and wet grass broke her fall in Zheng Du City, Central China . Zheng and the youngster were playing at home on Sunday when Jiaojiao said she was hungry. Her mother closed the windows and doors and left the flat for 10 minutes while she bought takeaway food. When Zheng returned, her daughter was nowhere to be seen. Believing Jiaojiao was playing hide-and-seek, she began looking in the wardrobes. To her horror, she discovered an open window and saw a crowd had begun to gather around a bench below. A lifeless child in a pink jacket was sprawled across it. ‘Did a toddler fall down?’ Zheng Jiayu shouted to the spectators, recognising the child's outfit. ‘She can still speak, come down quickly,’ the neighbours called back. Jiaojiao was bleeding from her eyes, nose and mouth, was covered in mud and kept asking for her mother. A neighbour had found the five-year-old lying on the grass and carried her to the bench. Jiaojiao was rushed to Chengdu Second People’s Hospital and a doctor said she had punctured her lung and sustained multiple fractures. Her pelvis had broken into pieces and she had severe bruising and scratches, as well as internal bleeding. Rain canopies, laundry racks and wet grass broke the little girl's fall and doctors said it was a miracle she was conscious . Jiaojiao's pelvis had broken into pieces and she had severe bruising and scratches, as well as internal bleeding . Luckily her head and neck were not injured and doctors said it was a miracle she was conscious. However, Jiaojiao went into a coma not long after she arrived at hospital because of excessive bleeding. She only regained consciousness after an emergency blood transfusion and an operation on a wound measuring 20cm in length. She was transferred to Huaxi Hospital and surgeons were able to repair the damage to her legs during a three-hour operation yesterday. Jiaojiao, holding back her tears before the operation, told her worried mother: 'Mum, I will get better day by day.' She is still in the intensive care unit but has already begun to ask for ice cream. Unfortunately she can only be fed through a tube. On the day of her fall, Jiaojiao’s father was at work and her grandparents were out of town. ‘I was supposed to be at work, but no one is at home,' said Zheng, who suspects her daughter pushed the window open. 'So I took a day off to watch my child.' Before the fall: Jiaojiao proudly shows off her picture of a pond before the accident at her home on Sunday . The family has been left with a large medical bill, estimated to be £100,000, compared to their £640 monthly income. ‘I am so happy that my child is alive, but the medical bill will be huge,’ Zheng said. ‘Not matter how difficult this road is, we hope to accompany our daughter every step of the way and create more miracles.' Neighbours have organised a fundraiser to help pay for Jiaojiao's treatment, her nursery has donated £1,000 and friends and family have given the family £960. Zheng added: ‘Jiaojiao is such a sweet-talker. She says hi to everyone in the neighbourhood. That’s why everyone loves her.'","Jiaojiao, 5, fell 150ft when her mother, Zheng Jiayu, left her at home alone .

An incident in the 38th minute of the game, saw Ayoze Perez felled by a reckless challenge from Dejan Lovren. Although replays clearly showed the defender scything Perez down and not making contact with the ball, Mason did not point to the spot. Neville said during his analysis, 'It was an absolute stonewall penalty. The gasp in the ground, Lovren just kicks him right in the knee.' Ayoze Perez drives into the Liverpool box on 38 minutes only to be brought down by Dejan Lovren . Lovren makes a rash challenge and does not make any contact with the ball, sending the Spaniard tumbling . Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville could not believe that a spot kick was not awarded to the Magpies at Anfield . He added that Mason's perfect positioning should have led him to make the correct call. 'I think we said it last week, in the game, we always look at the ref's position. But you look at Lee Mason's view of it and he's got no excuse, he's staring right at it there, he's so close, within five or six yards. It's just a poor decision.' Before Lovren's foul, Raheem Sterling had put Liverpool in front with a curling effort just inside the box on 9 minutes; and Joe Allen wrapped up the three points for the home side with a rifled shot into the roof of the net late on following a failed clearance from Mike Williamson. The misery was only to be compounded for Newcastle, as stand-in captain Moussa Sissoko saw red for a second bookable offence.

6438,029a691b9c08cb7a285ba4c00d2a3d4c2c5b6cde,"At first glance the rectangular island of Por-Bajin looks like a foreboding fortress or prison, with its regular structure and ruined sections. But it is unknown for certain what the rectangular island and its labyrinthine ruins, located in a lake in deepest Siberia, was actually used for when it was built 1,300 years ago. Historians and scientists are divided, but some experts believe the isolated area may have been built to attract people instead imprisoning them, and suggest it was a summer palace, monastery, or an astronomical observatory. The mysterious island, Por-Bajin, was found in the centre of a remote lake high in the mountains of southern Siberia . A reconstruction sought to show what the island could have looked like before it was ruined . The fortress is located about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition . The name Por-Bajin translates as 'clay house' in the Tuvan language, and the island sits between the Sayan and Altai ranges, about 3,800km from Moscow near the Mongolian border. The location was first discovered in 1891, and the purpose of island has still not been explained over a century later. More in-depth research took place in 2007 with archaeologists discovering clay tablets of human feet, faded coloured drawings on the plaster of the walls, giant gates and fragments of burnt wood. Experts say the island was built during the period of the Uighur Khaganate (744-840 AD) but it is not clear what their motive would be for constructing a fortress for in such a solitary place – as it is far from big settlements and trade routes. Archaeologists conducted limited and inconclusive excavations at the site in the 1950s and 1960s . The ruined structures have led experts to believe the island was used as a fortress or prison . The island has baffled experts for over a hundred years who say it could have been anything from a prison, to a palace or monastry . The plot thickens as the way it was built, along with the construction materials use, hint at Chinese architectural tradition. Scientists were able to use laser mapping to create a 3D image of what the 3.5 hectare plot could have been used for. Although it is said to be around 1,300 years old, many walls were intact and well preserved with a main structure in the inner courtyard being separated into two parts, covered by a tiled roof walkway supported by 36 wooden columns on stone bases. Isolated ruins! The fortress is connected to other land via a small walkway . Irina Arzhantseva of the Russian Academy of Sciences is now digging here for the Por-Bajin Cultural Foundation to find out just when the complex was built and why . Even more confusing than the debate of why it was created is the question of why it was abandoned. Researches have noted the lack of heating systems on the island, despite it enduring harsh Siberian weather and being located 7,545 feet above sea level. Russian president Vladimir Putin visited the island with Prince Albert of Monaco in 2007 and echoed the confusion. 'I have been to many places, I have seen many things, but I have never seen anything of the kind,' he said. Por-Bajin ('clay House' in the Tuvan language) was long thought to be a fortress built by the Uighurs . The few artifacts unearthed at the site seem to date it to the mid-eighth century .

But UK buyers who are prepared to wait to get their hands on the eagerly anticipated wearable may want to snap up an Apple Watch on holiday, because Britain is the most expensive place in the world to buy one. The most expensive Edition model costs up to £2,500 more in the UK compared to elsewhere in the world, while at the lower end of the scale British buyers pay up to £63 more for the Sport model. Britain is the most expensive place in the world in buy the Apple Watch. The three models are pictured above. The Sport, shown left is round £63 more expensive in the UK than the US and there is a difference in price of over £1,230 when it comes to the luxurious Watch Edition (right) The gadget is available to pre-order in nine countries. The cheapest model is the 38mm Sport version and costs £299 in the UK. In the US, the same model costs $349, but this doesn't include sales tax. Sales tax in the US depends on the region where the product is sold, but as an example California has one of the highest rates - at 9% - while Montana has zero. With both of these sales taxes added to the price of the Sports model in the US, the total cost works out at $380.41 (£257) and $349 (£236) in the respective states. This is a difference of £42 when bought in California, compared to the UK, and £63 when compared to Montana. The effect is magnified for the top-of-the-range Edition version, which costs from £8,000 for the 38mm model in Britain, compared to a starting price of $10,000 in the US. At the time of writing, $10,000 converts to £6,769 - which equates to a difference of £1,231 before charges are taken into account. The most expensive version of the 38mm edition in the UK is £13,500 in the UK, and $17,000 in the US. When sales taxes are added to the US model, the price rises to $18,530 in California, which converts to £12,543 - a difference of £957. All prices shown in the table above are for the most expensive option in each model and region. Prices also include all relevant sales taxes. Beneath each foreign price is the conversion rate in GBP. In the US, California was chosen because it has one of the highest sales taxes at 9%, while Montana was chosen for the opposite end of the scale because it doesn't have a sales tax. Quebec in Canada has one of the highest sales taxes at 15%, while Alberta has one of the lowest at 5%. Prices and conversions were correct at the time of writing. But the difference isn't just visible between the UK and US. In Australia, for example, the most expensive 38mm Edition costs $21,000 AUD, which converts to £10,832 - a difference of around £2,665 compared to the UK. In fact, during MailOnline investigations the UK price for all three models of the watch, in both sizes with all sales taxes included, still works out more expensive in all the other regions where the watch is currently available for pre-order. The only places the Watch works out cheaper in the UK is when it's compared to the most expensive 42mm Edition model in Australia and China, or the 38mm Edition in Quebec and China. Explaining the price differences, Apple told MailOnline: 'UK prices include VAT. US prices don't include sales tax.' Sales tax is calculated by multiplying the purchase price by the  tax rate, which varies widely by jurisdiction, and ranges from zero to around 15 per cent in Canada. The gadget is now available in nine countries, with the cheapest model – the 38mm Sport version costing £299 in the UK. Here, Apple Watch fans in Beijing looking at the devices behind glass and on a display stand . The Apple Watch will go on sale in Apple shops and selected department stores on April 24.

It comes in three different versions - Sport, Watch and Edition - with each one made from different materials, such as anodized aluminium, stainless steel and 18 karat yellow or rose gold. Customers can choose either a 38mm or 42mm face, with an estimated battery of around 18 hours. These price discrepancies don't just apply to Apple products, however. MailOnline recently compared prices for the Sony PlayStation 4, GoPro Hero4 Silver edition action camera, Samsung Galaxy Gear 2 Neo in black and the Apple iPad Air 2. The US is also the cheapest place to buy the 38mm Apple Watch, where it costs $549 (£366) - £110 cheaper than in the UK where it’s on sale for £479. The watch has already gone on display in  Apple stores across these regions, as well as in Galeries Lafayette in Paris (pictured), Isetan in Tokyo and Selfridges in London . Prices were compared on both the UK and US Amazon sites, plus PC World in the UK and Best Buy in the US – with all taxes and VAT included. At the time of the research, the PlayStation 4 cost £327 from Amazon UK and £349 from PC World. This was compared to $435 in the US, which converts to £272. For the GoPro Hero 4 camera, prices were closer between the two countries, but UK customers still paid up to £17 more for the device. In terms of the Samsung Gear 2 Neo, prices ranged from £135 ($216) on the American Amazon site up to £190 on its UK equivalent. And Apple’s price discrepancy doesn’t just apply to its own store. Customers buying the Apple iPad Air 2 from other retailers pay £399 in the UK at PC World, compared to £340 ($544) at Best Buy in the US.

The video captured by William Bird while out with his seven-year-old stepson Alex shows the £126million jets approaching RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland. The first of the aircraft - which can reach 1,370mph - blasted them with the thrust from its engines, while as the second jet disappeared from view the video camera was knocked sideways. Scroll down for video . Incoming: The video shows two of the £126million jets approaching RAF Lossiemouth in Moray, Scotland . Overhead: As the second jet disappeared from view in the clip, the video camera was knocked sideways . The video was taken on the same day that Typhoons were deployed by the Royal Air Force as two Russian long-range Bear bombers, capable of carrying nuclear missiles, hugged British airspace. Mr Bird, who runs an aerial photography business in Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, captured the video on Tuesday with a Go Pro 4 while on holiday with his family. The 41-year-old said that he was ‘as close to the action as you could get’, having gone to the area after hearing on the news that Nato exercises were taking place in the area. He said: ‘I went to see what I could capture. I wasn't really sure what I would get but it was fantastic watching the video back. ‘They came in very low and were preparing to land, but they were still under quite a lot of throttle. To see that much thrust is quite astonishing. My stepson is still making jet noises.’ He added: ‘It's the first time I've seen a Typhoon in flight and the noise was just incredible. Caught on camera: Mr Bird took the video on Tuesday with a Go Pro 4 while on holiday with his family . 'You can hear it approach from far away, but when it's above you have to fight every instinct not to duck or put your hands over your ears. ‘Shortly after taking this video we were actually told we should probably move a bit away since the planes were coming in to land.’ As well as the bombers on Tuesday, a Russian warship strayed close to UK territory in another apparent attempt to test Britain’s defences. A destroyer with missiles, anti-aircraft guns and torpedoes entered the English Channel with two other Russian ships. It forced the UK to send a heavily-armed frigate to monitor the vessels. Just a few hours later the Bear bombers hugged UK airspace. Sources claim both incidents may have been an attempt to ‘snoop’ on the Nato war games exercise taking place in Scotland. Even though Russian military inspectors were invited to attend the show of strength, the timing raised suspicions that Vladimir Putin was using access to the site to test UK reaction times. It later emerged that the Russians had actually been at the Typhoons’ base at RAF Lossiemouth when the warplanes were scrambled.","William Bird, 41, captured footage as jets approached RAF Lossiemouth .

Areas of flash flooding were commonplace throughout St. Louis County before the band of severe weather crept out of the region before noon Tuesday, she added. KMOV-TV reported that a lightning strike caused a Mississippi River traffic signal on the Eads Bridge linking Missouri and Illinois to malfunction. Crews notified the Coast Guard to inform any barge traffic of the issue. Later in the day, storms in southwestern Indiana toppled trees and downed power lines.

Micky Adams became the 42nd manager to be dismissed this season when he was fired on Sunday by Tranmere, rock bottom of the Football League. Forty sackings were recorded by the League Managers’ Association before the end of March, which was an all-time high, and the trend is set to smash its previous record of 46, set in 2006-07. Micky Adams left his role with Tranmere, who are bottom of the Football League, on Sunday . Gus Poyet is one of five Premier League manager to be sacked during this season . 2005-06: 25 . 2006-07: 30 . 2007-08: 29 . 2008-09: 28 . 2009-10: 23 . 2010-11: 34 . 2011-12: 28 . 2012-13: 36 . 2013-14: 32 . 2014-15: 40 . The Championship remains the most dangerous terrain. Malky Mackay, fired by Wigan this month, was the 17th to go in the second tier, where the average tenure is less than a year, thanks partly to trigger-happy clubs like Leeds. There have been 10 sackings in both League One and League Two, while the Barclays Premier League has been relatively safe, with five dismissals, not including those who quit — Alan Pardew from Newcastle and Tony Pulis from Crystal Palace. Amid the chaos, Arsene Wenger remains the longest serving boss with more than 18 years at Arsenal, followed by Paul Tisdale, who has been at Exeter for nearly nine years, and Karl Robinson, close to five years at MK Dons. Malky Mackay became the 17th Championship manager to be sacked this season earlier in April . YEARS/MONTHS . A Wenger (Arsenal)                            18/7 .

Robinson’s longevity at Milton Keynes is intriguing since he has resisted interest from several other clubs but he and chairman Pete Winkelman have forged a close bond. ‘There were times when I could have gone and I chose to stay,’ said Robinson. ‘And the chairman will tell you there were times when he could have moved me on, and had to think twice, because results haven’t always been great. ‘It’s increasingly difficult for managers and I’m very fortunate with my chairman. We have an amazing relationship and I’ll always be indebted to him for this opportunity. I would have felt a bit of a fraud if I’d walked away.’ Robinson joined MK Dons in 2007, initially as a coach under Paul Ince. He has seen the club evolve and his team are one point from the automatic promotion places with three games to play in League One. MK Dons are at home to Doncaster tonight and fans will have an eye on Preston, one point better off, who are playing at Notts County. As other managers look longingly at Winkelman’s patience, Robinson explains how the unique nature of MK Dons has encouraged continuity at the top. ‘This is a very controversial club,’ he said. ‘We’re growing an identity within an industry that was reluctant to accept us and I think that is harder to achieve if you chop and change your manager.’","The most managerial sackings in a single season stands at 46 in 2006-07 .

3593,0f2ebc922213375a0f0ce8c2e82637791dec0687,"Two thieves murdered a pensioner and dumped his body in an abandoned mine then made it look like a cycling accident, a court heard today. Kevin Cooper and Trewen Kevern allegedly beat David Alderson and left him to drown, before using his keys to steal £40,000 from a safe where he also kept a haul of guns. Police originally thought that the 72-year-old victim - a keen cyclist - had died as a result of falling from his bike, because he was dressed in lycra at the time. Killed: David Alderson was found dead in an abandoned copper mine in January last year . But Truro Crown Court heard that Kevern, 22 and Cooper, 34 - two cousins whose relatives were close to Mr Alderson - lured him to a disused mine at Wheal Maid near Carharrack in Devon and killed him in January last year. Prosecutor Martin Meeke QC told the jury: 'David Alderson was beaten about the head, possibly until he was unconscious. His body was dragged to a pond into which he was dumped face down. 'In the pond he drowned. “Whether his head was forced down into the water we cannot be sure. The only survivors were these defendants.”' Trial: Kevin Cooper is accused of murdering Mr Alderson alongside his cousin Trewen Kevern . Cooper and Kevern then went to the victim's flat in Falmouth and used his stolen keys to steal £40,000 in cash which he kept in a safe. Mr Meeke said of Mr Alderson: '”He was a keen cyclist and frequently to be seen around Falmouth on a racing bike. He often wore cycling shoes and leggings even when he was not on his bike. '“He was wearing such an outfit when his body was found in the pond. It was at first thought that he had a cycling accident. '“Cycling was not his only interest. Another interest was guns. He had a collection of guns. All the guns were licensed and were legally held by David Alderson. There were ten of them there.” 'He was a member of the Land’s End Shooting Club and he had a substantial amount of ammunition at his flat –- the guns and ammo were held in two different safes in his flat.' The jury heard that Mr Alderson, who kept the keys to his flat, car and safe on a cord round his neck, was 'not short of cash' and had once withdrawn more than £43,000 in £50 notes from his local bank. He was planning to buy a third safe for 'something highly illegal', believed to be two unlicensed guns, the court was told. Kevern's sister Tammy lived in a flat below Mr Alderson, and grew close to the pensioner before his death, calling him 'granddad', jurors heard. Discovery: Mr Alderson's body was found at the Wheal Maid mine in Cornwall . Mr Alderson gave Tammy a £1,000 gift and changed the terms of his will to leave his estate to her instead of his own estranged children. Mr Meeke said that on the night of his death, Cooper had lured Mr Alderson to the disused copper mine by making him think he was collecting the illegal guns he wanted. After they killed him, Cooper and Kevern made up a cover story about robbing a travellers' site in order to hide the truth from their family, the court heard. Both defendants deny murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David Alderson, 72, was found dead in a Cornish copper mine last January .

3059,557d962b861d3eac3b6e908067cfad1839b7c7c6,"Whatever caused small space rocks to lump together billions of years ago, magnetism is unlikely to be the reason. Scientists announced today that measurements made by the European space probe Philae, which landed on comet 67P in November, show the comet's core isn't magnetised. Some astrophysicists have suggested that magnetism might have been responsible for aligning and then binding together rocks into larger boulders during the early stages of planet formation. A composite of 18 images showing off the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko activity from different angles as seen between 31 January (top left) and 25 March (bottom right), when the spacecraft was at distances of about 30 to 100 km from the comet . But in a paper published online by the journal Science, the team led by Hans-Ulrich Auster at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, said their data — which benefited from three unexpected bounces that allowed Philae to collect more results than planned — don't support this theory. 'If the surface was magnetised, we would have expected to see a clear increase in the magnetic field readings as we got closer and closer to the surface,' said Auster. 'If comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is representative of all cometary nuclei, then we suggest that magnetic forces are unlikely to have played a role in the accumulation of planetary building blocks greater than one meter (3 feet) in size.' Allan H. Treiman, a senior scientist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas, who wasn't involved in the study, said the results credibly suggest other forces were responsible. Magnetic  data before (top) and after (bottom) the cliff collision at between the first and second touchdowns. Height above the surface is plotted on the x-axis and magnetic field strength on the y-axis. The measurements (crosses) are compared with a hypothetical model (solid line) assuming a slightly magnetised surface . data collected by the Rosetta Plasma Consortium fluxgate magnetometer on board the orbiter (top) and the Rosetta Lander Magnetometer and Plasma Monitor on board the lander (bottom) have been used to investigate the magnetic properties of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . Studying the properties of a comet can provide clues to the role that magnetic fields played in the formation of Solar System bodies almost 4.6 billion years ago. The infant Solar System was once nothing more than a swirling disc of gas and dust but, within a few million years, the Sun burst into life in the centre of this turbulent disc, with the leftover material going into forming the asteroids, comets, moons and planets. The dust contained an appreciable fraction of iron, some of it in the form of magnetite. Indeed, millimetre-sized grains of magnetic materials have been found in meteorites, indicating their presence in the early Solar System. This leads scientists to believe that magnetic fields threading through the proto-planetary disc could have played an important role in moving material around as it started to clump together to form larger bodies. 'Auster did not find any magnetic field, with a very sensitive instrument, so it seems unlikely that magnetism in the solar nebula was significant for the collection of meter-sized objects,' Treiman said in an email. 'At that scale, it seems likely that electrostatic or gravitational attraction would be stronger.' The findings are part of a series of scientific results obtained by scientists analyzing data collected by the Philae lander and its mothership Rosetta, which is flying alongside the comet on its elliptical orbit around the sun. Magnetic data providing an estimate of the final landing region. Initially, Philae was seen to rotate slowly during the descent to Agilkia. It landed and then bounced, rotating significantly faster as the momentum of the internal flywheel was transferred to the lander .

In January 2013, Dorian Poe, from Burlington, Ontario, sent his favorite toy out on the global adventure, having been inspired by the story of a cancer-stricken girl who, unable to live her own dreams of world travel, sent her teddy bear in her place. Hoping to raise the same level of global awareness about his own condition, Dorian decided to send his Ganz Webkinz bear, called Tikko, out into the world, carrying with him a message of understanding and tolerance for those affected by autism. Scroll down for video . 'It's okay to be different': Dorian Poe, 11, with his beloved bear Tikko, whose travels have raised awareness for autism all over the world . With the help and support of his mother Christine, Dorian, who was then nine years old, sent Tikko off on the first leg of his adventure in back in January 2013. Now, the bear has circled the globe and then some, continuing to share his vital message, while inviting the world to join in with his journey online. 'When I first decided to support Dorian in his campaign, it was because I was happy to see him want to “pay it forward”' Christine tells DailyMail.com. 'I fundraise each year to pay the $24,500.00/year tuition it costs for Dorian to go to a special needs school. I was thrilled to support Tikko because Dorian had found a way to give back to our community; a community that has been wonderful at supporting our fundraising efforts.' Hello, my name is Dorian. I have autism, and so does my pet polar bear Tikko. Tikko is about to go traveling on an adventure; and I need you to take care of him. My polar bear wants to raise autism awareness. Just call him 'Tikko the Autism Bear' or 'Tikko'. Guess what, this guy is much more different than the other polar bears you know. Things you should look out for: . To accompany Tikko the autistic bear on his adventures, Dorian included a letter explaining the characteristics and challenges involved in having autism – using the toy to help other people understand what the various aspects of the condition can feel like. Each family who receivedTikko on his travels would take on the job of raising awareness in his or her community – helping to spread Dorian’s message across the globe, while he remained at home in Canada. But the mother and son could never have known what a phenomenon Tikko would become. 'In January when Tikko took his first trip to Jamaica, I connected with another mom there whose child had autism,' Christine explains. 'There was little to no support for autism in Jamaica.' Hearing such a story from so far away, Christine began to research autism in the other countries Tikko was visiting, and she shared what she learned on the campaign's Facebook page. And two weeks after the Tikko had begun his adventures, Christine became involved in coordinating them. After media attention grew, and demand for visits from Tikko increased, Christine received a donation of new Tikkos from toy company GANZ, who offered 600 bears to the cause in order to help the family cope with the overwhelming amount of interest. ‘For the first few months there was only one Tikko,’ Christine explained. ‘It wasn’t long before we realized we could reach people faster by having more Tikko’s available. So I wrote to GANZ (the maker of the Webkinz Polar Bear), and to date they have donated 600 polar bears to us!’ With so many Tikko bears in the mix, running the campaign became a full-time job for Christine. At the gate: Tikko made it to 24 countries in his first 10 months of traveling . A towering success: The little bear has made it to some of the world's most instantly-recognizable landmarks . She keeps supporters informed with daily updates on Tikko's location on Facebook and Twitter, receives new Tikko travel photos every day, and promotes the awareness campaign across autism networking sites. However, Christine says: 'No matter how busy I am, I always have time to listen and offer support to those dealing with the challenges of having a child on the spectrum.' Tikko's Facebook page documents every destination he has reached in dozens of photos. He's posed at some of the world's most famous landmarks, hobnobbed with A-list celebrities, and even scraped the skies in a daring aerial show, all the while broadcasting the important message splashed across his T-shirt: 'Autism…it’s okay to be different!' The campaign has affected children all over the world who have autism, not in the least the young boy who started it all. A message in motion: Tikko spreads awareness with his motto: 'Autism…it’s okay to be different!' Getting back to his roots: Tikko has even made it as far as the North Pole, which was a dream of owner Dorian . 'Dorian feels a sense of purpose,' says mom Christine. 'He feels he is not only helping the world, but also his school peers. He’s gained confidence, and he’s made & kept friends more easily. 'He’s matured a great deal since starting his campaign. It has also brought us closer together – we share a very special bond.' Today there are still 20 Tikkos on the go, and the work is far from over. 'Tikko is still travelling, and will be for many years to come!' says Christine. 'He is just back from Kuwait, Lithuania, Nice and Scotland. He’s currently in Germany. 'Another Tikko is on the set of the Dragon's Den. Another Tikko is packed and ready to visit Mount Fuji in Japan. The list goes on. Tikko is one busy bear!'","Dorian Poe, 11, from Burlington, Ontario, sends his stuffed polar bear Tikko to other children around the world .

10337,0da0f4dae1c2de3f34f18a4623e54b6411d56912,"An Afghan interpreter who risked his life on the front line with British troops was shot with his two-year-old son by Taliban hitmen after he says he was ‘abandoned’ by the UK Government. The 26-year-old, who was known as ‘Chris’ by UK soldiers, was hit in the leg when gunmen opened fire near his home in Khost, eastern Afghanistan. His son Muhammad also sustained injuries in the attack, which Chris says was the latest in a series of attempts to kill or kidnap him because of his time spent helping the British Government – which now won’t let him come to the UK. Shot: 'Chris' the interpreter (left) and his son Muhammad (right) was badly injured by Taliban gunmen near their home in Khost, eastern Afghanistan. He said it is one of several attempts made to kill or kidnap him . During more than three years with UK forces, Chris worked with elite units including the SAS, Royal Marines and Parachute Regiment. The father-of-two, who spent two months in hospital after the shooting, said he has taken evidence of threats to UK authorities on ten occasions – but has repeatedly been dismissed and told merely to take more security precautions. He claims he has also narrowly escaped a kidnap attempt, and now has to hide in a network of hostels. He said: ‘I worked outside military bases with UK forces where I took huge personal risk on a daily basis – I served with distinction, placing myself in mortal danger to save my British colleagues. ‘My family and I have experienced a serious threat to life as a consequence of working for the British, resulting – most recently – in me being shot on December 26 when the Taliban came to my village looking for me. ‘My son was hit too. This only happened because of my work with the British. The Government has totally forgotten its allies who helped them during the worst of times here. I have seen British soldiers die in front me and I have collected soldiers’ remains – now I think I am being abandoned.’ Chris – who worked for British forces between October 2008 and April 2011 – claims that UK commanders are aware that he was forced to stop working for the soldiers because of threats to his family made by the Taliban. Blood: The aftermath of another attack on an interpreter. Chris says they are at risk but that his concerns have been dismissed by the British Government . Danger: Despite attacks such as this, the majority of frontline interpreters who want to build new lives in the UK do not qualify for the immigration scheme . But like the majority of frontline translators who want to build new lives in the UK, Chris does not qualify for an immigration scheme because of his dates of service. The scheme is only available to those with at least a year’s continuous service after December 2011. So far just one of more than 300 Afghan interpreters who say they have been threatened by the Taliban because of their work with British soldiers has been given a UK visa. Last night, as it emerged that a Taliban thug suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds, Rafi – who is leading the fight to help other interpreters stay in the UK – said: ‘Human rights? Do only criminals and those who have killed British soldiers and translators have human rights? Doors are opened to them but closed to us. Shattered: The interpreter's car was badly damaged in the attack. Just one of more than 300 Afghan interpreters who say they have been threatened by Taliban because of their work has been given a UK visa . Lawyers will point out that the shooting is just one of scores of occasions when interpreters have been targeted . ‘It is disgusting the way we are being treated. We are not even being treated like human beings, my colleagues have to live in the shadows with their families looking over their shoulders constantly in fear of death whereas the Taliban are being allowed to stay with all the benefits from the British taxpayer. It is like we are the terrorists and they are the heroes.’ Rafi, who fears giving his full name, was blown up by the Taliban in a blast that killed a British officer. He is now involved in a court case next month challenging the UK’s position on translators. A judicial review brought by Rafi and one other Afghan interpreter is to challenge whether the Government complied with its statutory obligations towards hundreds of translators – and the attack on Chris and his son earlier this year will be highlighted. Lawyers will point out that the shooting is just one of scores of occasions when interpreters have been targeted. At least 20 interpreters serving with British troops were killed in action and dozens wounded while serving with UK forces. Six were murdered by the Taliban while on leave and five are said to have been hunted down since UK forces left. They claim the threat of violent reprisals from the Taliban has grown since British forces withdrew from Afghanistan and that many are in hiding unable to work and having to move regularly to escape assassination units. Two years ago The Mail interviewed 31 former translators in the Afghan capital Kabul who claimed to be in fear of their lives. Out of ten contacted last week, six said they had survived direct threats in recent months. One said : ‘Many families have been attacked, some relatives killed, others tortured and people loyal to the British military are living in hiding.’ UK officials deny that their translators have been ‘abandoned’, and stress that each case is individually examined and assessed by British officials in Afghanistan. Asked about Chris’s claims, the Ministry of Defence said it could not discuss individual cases. Taliban henchman accused of murder CAN stay here: Man who 'killed governor's son' in Afghanistan wins right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds . By Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent for The Daily Mail . Home Secretary Theresa May initially rejected the 32-year-old's claim for sanctuary - but immigration judges have now thrown out her decision . A Taliban henchman suspected of murder in Afghanistan has won the right to stay in Britain on human rights grounds. The 32-year-old, known only by the initials SAKA, has admitted that his father was in charge of 65 Taliban troops, but claimed he only agreed to join the terrorist group because he was worried about his safety. Court papers reveal that he was arrested when he was caught trying to desert the Taliban, and accused of killing a provincial governor’s son. The papers go on to say: ‘The appellant claims he then spent four years in prison but was never formally convicted. He claims he was tortured and beaten.’ SAKA alleges that he managed to escape from prison and eventually travel to the UK. The Home Office was asked to consider whether he had actually been convicted of murder and whether his presence in Britain ‘constituted a danger to the community’. The Afghan, whose identity has been kept secret by the courts, had an initial claim for sanctuary rejected by Home Secretary Theresa May. But immigration judges have now thrown out her decision and given SAKA permission to stay. It was ruled that deporting him would breach Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Experts said he would be ‘at risk of mistreatment and physical harm if he were arrested on account of being a suspected Taliban’. Hearing the case in the Immigration and Asylum Chamber, Judge Helen Rimington ruled that if SAKA were sent home the Taliban ‘might be informed ’. He would also be at risk from the current Afghan government on the basis of his former membership of the Taliban, she said. Last night a former British commander criticised the judgment and demanded a shake-up of human rights legislation so it could not be exploited by former insurgents. Colonel Richard Kemp, who led UK forces in Afghanistan, said: ‘Our blind adherence to European human rights legislation sees British soldiers who risk their lives to defend us hounded through the courts while this enemy fighter is allowed to stay here to threaten our country. ‘Our security at home already has enough challenges from jihadists returning from Syria without our own courts wantonly adding to our problems in this way. This case underlines the urgent need to change the law to prevent such dangerous absurdities.’","'Chris', who  worked with SAS and Marines, was shot near home in Khost .

Keats, a San Francisco writer and self-described experimental philosopher and conceptual artist, has designed a 'millennium camera' that he intends to mount in a churchless steeple on a college campus. He hopes the resulting photograph will chronicle climate change by taking a 1,000-year exposure of a western Massachusetts mountain range. Jonathan Keats, an experimental philosopher, hopes to capture 1,000 years of changes at a mountain range in Massachusetts with his 'millennium camera' The camera, which is made of cooper and allows light to enter through a tiny hole and change paint inside, will create one image that Keats says will display centuries of changes to the environment . If it seems far-fetched, consider that some of Keats' previous endeavors include selling tracts of real estate in the theoretical extra dimensions of space-time and opening a photosynthetic restaurant that serves gourmet sunlight to plants. He has also been involved in choreographing honeybees; copyrighting his own mind to give his 'intellectual property' a 70-year post-life extension; and, controversially, joining in a bid to genetically engineer God. Even at his quirkiest, Keats notes he always has a serious message to deliver. In the case of the millennium camera — a cylindrical device small and light enough to hold in one hand but hopefully durable enough to survive the centuries — it's encouraging people to think beyond their own human lifespan to what geologists call deep time, the lengthy periods in which the world changes on a grand scale. 'We need to find a way to think in deep time if we are to responsibly make use of the technologies we have,' he says. 'So the camera is intended, in a sense, as a mental prosthesis, as a way of creating some sort of a feedback loop in deep time, where setting up the camera now, looking out into the far future, allows for people who are alive in the far future to see the decisions we made through the effect that they had.' But will it work? The camera will be place on the Stearns Steeple, and the Mead Art Museum at Amherst plans on holding an exhibition to show the resulting photo in the 3015 . Keats hopes that the long-term photograph will make people think about time frames longer than their lives, such as the centuries that it takes for nature such as the Holyoke mountain range (pictured) to transform . Even Keats can't say for sure. Nor is he certain humans will be around in 3015. Nor, assuming they are, that someone will know to retrieve the camera and open it. A thousand years is, after all, a long time. In 1015, the Norman conquest of England was still more than 50 years away, the first crusade was more than 80 years away, and Columbus would not reach the New World for another 477 years. The camera, Keats explains, is very simple, so simple that nothing mechanically should fail. 'Which of course is the wrong thing to say, because then it will,' he quickly adds. It begins as the old science fair standby, the pinhole camera, which allows light to enter through a tiny aperture. But since pinhole cameras aren't designed to last a thousand years, Keats made his of copper because of its resistance to corrosion. The pinhole he pierced through a rugged 24-karat gold plate. To capture the exposure, Keats adapted a Renaissance art technique by using rose madder, a sturdy, organic-based oil paint, applied directly to the copper in the back of the camera. Digital photography was impractical, and he ruled out using film because it would deteriorate too quickly and besides, there's always the chance by 3015 that society will revert to another dark age, without photochemical processing skills. 'All you have to do is open up the camera and you'll see the image,' Keats says. That image will be of the Holyoke Range, a modest but picturesque mountain chain that scientists believe has existed for 200 million years. What a denizen of the 31st century would see is not a before-and-after image, not what today we might call time-lapse photography, but rather one picture depicting a millennium of change. For example, if the now heavily forested area were to gradually turn to grasslands, the trees, Keats predicts, will linger on the photograph as ghostly reminders of a prior period, set against the bolder outline of the more recent landscape. 'So what you're getting in a sense is ... a movie of the full period, of the full thousand years, but all compressed into a single frame,' he says. Stearns Steeple at bucolic Amherst College, where Keats studied philosophy in the 1990s, will serve as the camera's tripod of sorts. Keats says that his ambitious project to make people think about 'deep time' may be a failure. Above, he explains his project at Amherst College . The philosopher and journalist hopes that citizens of the 31st century will look at his image taken from a camera on Stearns Steeple at Amherst College . Once part of Stearns Church, the Gothic Revival steeple was retained as a freestanding structure after the church was demolished in 1949. Keats hopes such resiliency bodes well for its long-term survival. The camera is currently on display steps away from the steeple at the school's Mead Art Museum, where it has generated a mix of interest and skepticism from visitors, according to the museum's curator, Vanja Malloy. 'It might seem silly, and people might say, 'What's the point of a camera with an exposure you'll never see in your lifetime, what's the point of any of it?'' Malloy says. 'But the fact that it is provocative in that way is what's so powerful about it.' Later this spring, Keats will ascend a harrowing set of wooden stairs inside the dusty steeple, position the camera and open its shutter, beginning what he believes will be history's longest exposure. He hasn't sought a patent for the device, which he estimates costs about $100 in raw materials to build, saying he wants others to copy it and place their own millennium cameras strategically around the world. 'I'm well overstating the case for these cameras,' he concedes. 'I realize (it) may seem like a supreme act of egotism. It's probably also an extreme act of naivety on my part. But I think you just have to give it a try.' He says it may take 10,000 years for humanity perfect the process of 1,000-year photos. The philosopher set up a similar 1,000-year camera at the Arizona State University Art Museum's sculpture garden as part of an effort to capture how the next millennium change Tempe, Arizona. The Amherst museum and the Arizona museum both plan to exhibit the photographs in 3015. He also gave 100-year cameras to some resident of Berlin, Germany, last year, he told Big Think.","Jonathon Keats, experimental philosopher, plans to photo Holyoke Range .

New training will commence at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. The complaint was filed on behalf of Malaika Singleton, who said she was subjected to a hair pat-down with weeks of each other while traveling from Los Angeles to London in December 2013. The Transportation Security Administration will 'enhance' officer training for hair pat-downs after complaints that African-American women were being racially targeted for unnecessary screenings (file photo) According to an ACLU statement, TSA agents grabbed Singleton's hair, which was styled in tightly-wound 'sisterlocks,' and proceeded to 'squeeze it from top to bottom' at LAX airport. Singleton's hair was patted down again two weeks later during a layover at Minneapolis International Airport and, once again, nothing was found. New training will commence at Los Angeles International Airport, one of the airports named in the complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union . 'The humiliating experience on countless black women who are routinely targeted for hair pat-downs because their hair is ""different"" is not only wrong, but also a great misuse of TSA agents' time and resources,' Novella Coleman, Singleton's ACLU attorney, said in a statement. In a letter sent to Coleman, the TSA said the re-training will stress 'race neutrality', and that a special emphasis will be placed on the 'hair patdowns of African-American female travelers'. TSA said the administration will also track of pat-down complaints filed by African-American women throughout the country to 'assess whether a discriminatory impact may be occurring at a specific' airport, according to the letter posted by Buzzfeed. This is not the first time TSA's pat-down policy has come under harsh light. Solange Knowles claimed in 2012 she was racially profiled while going through security at Miami airport, dubbing it 'Discrim-FRO-nation' because she wears her hair in the Afro style. 'My hair is not a storage drawer,' she tweeted. An agency spokesman later told CNN that the 'advanced imaging technology machine' only shows 'an outline of an individual' that was 'the same for every single person'. 'If the hair area is highlighted, the machine may have picked up an anomaly or a possible threat in the head area', such as bobby pins, hair and extension clips, or head wraps. Solange Knowles claimed in 2012 she was racially profiled while going through security at Miami airport, dubbing it 'Discrim-FRO-nation' because she wears her hair in the Afro style . But ACLU said it was these kinds of 'subjective rules' that made the agency more susceptible to 'unconsciously interpret the circumstances in a way that is consistent with racial stereotypes'. In a statement released Friday, the TSA said they do not tolerate racial profiling, according to The Hill. 'Not only is racial profiling prohibited under DHS and agency policy, but it is also an ineffective security tactic.' Coleman told the Huffington Post she will be looking for 'clear and objective guidelines' from the TSA when she attends the LAX training later this month.","TSA agreed to make changes after ACLU filed official complaint .

4983,e043af326baa328259004d51206b57a684d69f95,"When it comes to DIY stereotypes suggest that men are more adept than women. But new research has revealed that females may actually be better at mastering the use of tools - at least among chimpanzees. Researchers have found that female chimps are more likely to use the tools to help them hunt for food while males tend to prefer capturing prey with their hands. Scroll down for video . Primatologists at Iowa State University recorded 300 hunts by chimps in Fongoli, Sénégal, and found female chimps were using tools to capture prey in 60 per cent of the observations. This female chimp has stripped a stick of leaves and uses it to flush out a bush baby from a hollow tree trunk . While the findings may provoke some to reassess their view of the opposite sex, the research may also provide tantalising hints at how humans first learned to use weapons to hunt. It suggests that early female humans were perhaps the first to begin fashioning simple tools to help them catch prey. It has been known that chimpanzees use tools like humans for more than 50 years. In 1960, Jane Goodall witnessed two chimps using twigs to fish for termites in the ground. This was the first time that an animal was observed to make a tool and use it for a specific purpose, other than humans. It was later found that the Gombe chimps use twigs, leaves and rocks in nine different ways to feed, drink, clean themselves, reach other objects and to fashion weapons. In communities outside Gombe National Park, communities make different tools. Chimpanzees make sponges by chewing leaves and dipping them into puddles of water so they can use them as drinking vessels. They have been observed using sticks and rocks to smash fruit and shells. Adult males sometimes hurl rocks and sticks like make-shift spears to intimidate rivals. This study said that chimps use  shoots from Alchornea hirtella to hunt aggressive army ants in a specific way. It is thought that the behaviour is passed from one generation to the next and is learned by young chimpanzees. Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, Dr Jill Pruetz, a primatologist at Iowa State University said: 'Savannah-dwelling chimpanzees at Fongoli, Sénégal, are the only non-human population known to systematically hunt vertebrate prey with tools. 'Acquiring vertebrate prey via tool use at Fongoli supports the hypothesis that early hominins intensified their tool technology to overcome environmental pressures and that even the earliest hominins were probably sophisticated enough to fashion tools for hunting. 'The behaviour of these chimpanzees demonstrates that hunting is less adult male-biased among our closest living relatives than previously believed when tools are used. 'If tool use enabled early hominins to reduce the need for physical characteristics (i.e. greater size, strength) to achieve hunting efficiency, such sexual dimorphism ultimately becomes less important regarding prey acquisition.' Scientists first reported chimps using spear-like sticks to hunt prey at Fongoli in Senegal in 2007, and it was later filmed by the BBC in their hugely successful natural history series Life Story. Over the following years Dr Pruetz and her team have recorded 308 hunts using tools. Tools tended to be used when the chimps were hunting bush babies, called Galago. When Dr Pruetz and her colleagues analysed the hunts they had recorded, however, they found that more of them tended to be carried out by female chimps. The findings were surprising as most hunting behaviour is conducted by males and overall they account for 70 per cent of all prey captured. The chimps at Fongoli in Senegal (shown above) are the only animals to regularly hunt for prey with tools. Scientists first reported chimps using spear-like sticks to hunt prey at Fongoli in Senegal in 2007, and it was later filmed by the BBC in their hugely successful natural history series Life Story . Researchers observed more female chimps using broken sticks like above to help them capture prey. However, the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands . However, the male chimpanzees tended to capture larger prey and used their hands. Females carried out 61 per cent of the hunts using tools. They found that even in hunts involving tools, male chimps would often capture prey driven into their hands by those wielding tools. Dr Pruetz added: 'What would often happen is the male would be in the vicinity of another chimp hunting with a tool, often a female, and the bush baby was able to escape the female and the male grabbed the bush baby as it fled.' She added: 'It's just another example of diversity in chimp behavior that we keep finding the longer we study wild chimps.' Other groups of chimpanzees have been seen to use tools in other ways to help them gather hard to reach food - such as using sticks to 'fish' for termites. Again these activities tend to be dominated by females, but Dr Pruetz said it could not be easily compared to the hunting behaviour seen at Fongoli. She said: 'Fishing for termites is a very different activity than jabbing for a bush baby.' Tool use by chimpanzees is now considered to be fairly widespread with many groups having been observed using stones or sticks to crack open nuts, fish for termites and in some cases to capture small mammals . 'With fishing, termites grab on to a twig and don't let go and the chimp eats the termites off the twig. 'When hunting, the bush baby tries to bite, escape or hide from the chimp. The chimps are really averse to being bitten by a bush baby.' Instead she believes there is something very specific about the open Savannah environment compared to forests that has driven the chimps living at Fongoli to use tools in this way. She said that hunting bush babies with tools may be a way of allowing them to get access to a highly nutritious food source without having to chase down their prey. Something similar may have happened with early humans as their environment changed to become more Savannah like. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'The Savannah environment might be viewed as the catalyst for tool-assisted hunting by Savannah chimpanzees in Sénégal in that apes here exploit prey that is largely ignored by forest-dwelling chimpanzees. 'Chimpanzees' preferred prey at other sites, the red colobus monkey (Piliocolobus badius) is absent in the dry, open Savannah-woodland at Fongoli. 'Galago hunting at Fongoli represents a high-energy, low-risk resource that members of various age–sex classes can take advantage of, similar to what is observed among tool-equipped human hunters. 'Additionally, typical adult male chimpanzee arboreal hunting behaviour was unlikely to be characteristic of early bipedal hominins given the latter's anatomical differences with living apes. 'With such anatomical changes in our lineage, tool use probably became increasingly important to hunting behaviour.'","Researchers recorded chimps hunting with tools at Fongoli in Sénégal .

The Islamist militant group Al-Shabaab is responsible for the attack in the center of Mogadishu, group spokesman Abu Musab said. The attack began when two suicide bombers detonated their car at the entrance of the two-story building housing the Ministry of Education, Culture & Higher Education, Somali National Security Ministry spokesman Mohamed Yusuf said. Five gunmen then entered the building, shooting people inside, Yusuf said. Security guards at the building, and, later, Somali special forces battled the gunmen inside, witnesses said. Soldiers from the African Union, who are in Somalia in part to support the government's fight against Al-Shabaab, teamed up with Somali security forces to shoot and kill the five attackers, Yusuf said. The attack killed four Somali soldiers and eight civilians, according to Yusuf. The special forces helped people out of the building while the attack was underway, city police Capt. Mohamud Abdi said. Ali Hassan, a man who was helped from the building, confirmed that a rescue operation was happening inside. Somalia-based Al-Shabaab has battled the country's government for years, aiming to overthrow it and turn the nation into a fundamentalist Islamic state. In recent years, the group also launched terror attacks beyond Somalia's borders, sometimes targeting non-Muslims. What is Al-Shabaab, and what does it want? Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College in neighboring Kenya, killing 147 people, mostly students. The terrorists separated Christians from Muslims and shot those who couldn't recite verses from the Quran, witnesses said. In Somalia, Al-Shabaab has been blamed for attacks that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers. Late last month, Al-Shabaab militants detonated a bomb and sprayed bullets at a Mogadishu hotel, leaving at least 20 people dead in an attack that lasted a number of hours. Among those killed was Yusuf Mohamed Ismail Bari-Bari, Somalia's permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland. Journalist Omar Nor reported from Mogadishu.

TEPCO spokesman Teruaki Kobayashi said the robot sufficiently collected temperature, radiation levels and images from parts of the platform just below the reactor core's bottom by the time it got stuck and became unrecoverable. Mr Kobayashi said the test also showed the robot tolerated radiation and that the radiation levels were significantly lower than anticipated. That means robots can last longer and some wireless device may even be usable, even though the radiation levels were way too high for humans to enter the area, even wearing protective gear. Although there were no fatalities from radiation exposure, 300,000 residents were moved from a 20-mile radius of the nuclear plant. In total there were nearly 16,000 deaths reported from the natural disaster and subsequent devastation. Three of the six reactors blew up when a tsunami measuring 9 on the Richter scale hit the region. Clean-up expected to take decades, and cost more than £18 billion. An investigation panel deduced the disaster had major elements of being 'man-made,' and there was a ''culture of complacency about nuclear safety and poor crisis management.' Data will be used to improve future damage assessments, which are crucial to the safe decommissioning of the plant damaged by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. TEPCO plans to send in a different, amphibious robot next year for further investigation of the three reactors that suffered meltdowns. Computer simulation and cosmic ray examinations have shown that almost all fuel rods in the Unit 1 reactor have melted, breached the core and are now lying at the bottom of the containment chamber. The nuclear plant is still being taken apart, and it is estimated it will take decades to make the area safe, as well as cost billions of pounds. With soil and water contaminated, nobody can live there yet, and it is unknown when the clean-up mission will be completed. Reports found that few cancers would be expected as a result of accumulated radiation exposures, although people in the area worst affected by the accident may have a slightly higher risk of developing certain cancers such as leukemia, solid cancers, thyroid cancer and breast cancer. Surveys show only a fifth of former residents want to return to living in the area. The plant has six reactors, three of which were offline when disaster struck on March 11, 2011. More than 300,000 people had to be evacuated after three of Fukushima's six reactors blew up following the huge tsunami which devastated the country over three years ago . Nearly 16,000 people lost their lives in the natural disaster and subsequent devastation . A magnitude-9.0 earthquake triggered a huge tsunami which swept into the plant and knocked out its backup power and cooling systems, leading to meltdowns at the three active reactors. The Fukushima Nuclear Accident Independent Investigation Commission found the nuclear disaster was 'manmade' and that its direct causes were all foreseeable. It stated that it had also failed to meet the most basic safety requirements, such as assessing the probability of damage, preparing for containing collateral damage from such a disaster, and developing evacuation plans. Decommissioning and dismantling all six reactors is a delicate, time-consuming process that includes removing the melted fuel from a highly radioactive environment, as well as all the extra fuel rods, which sit in cooling pools at the top of the reactor buildings. Workers, who wear protective suits when dismantling the plant, must determine the exact condition of the melted fuel debris and develop remote-controlled and radiation-resistant robotics to deal with it. The process is expected to take at least 40 years. Contamination levels are low, which means people can, for a limited time, view the destruction site .

The Denmark international was due to start the match but ended up being dropped from the entire squad after his poor timekeeping landed him in hot water with manager Dieter Hecking. The Wolfsburg boss probably didn't need an invitation to lose his temper after watching his side crumble to a 4-1 home defeat by Napoli in the Europa League on Thursday and was obviously angered when Bendtner rolled up late the next day. Nicklas Bendtner was dropped from the Wolfsburg squad for Sunday's game after arriving late for training . Manager Dieter Hecking said that Bendtner would have started the match if he hadn't turned up late . 'Nicklas was going to play from the beginning but our training session was clearly earlier than he thought,' said boss Hecking. Sporting director Klaus Allofs added: 'There are a lot of ways of finding out when training is. And it is not as if there is that much traffic in Wolfsburg.' Hecking, speaking to Danish newspaper BT, said: 'As a team we have some rules that everyone should keep. When you break those rules you have to take the consequences. But we have spoken to Nicklas and everything is OK again.' Bendtner responded to the decision to drop him on Instagram on Sunday. He wrote: 'Stay strong and look forward. Mistakes can be made, but you got to deal with it and keep progressing.' The 27-year-old has only scored once in 16 league appearances this season since his arrival in Germany last summer.

'We are taking this step out of an abundance of caution to ensure that we are doing everything possible to provide our consumers with safe products and to preserve the trust we have built with them and their families for more than a century,' the company said in a statement. Last month, the company and health officials said a 3-ounce cup of ice cream contaminated with listeriosis was traced to a plant in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Scroll down for video . Blue Bell Ice Cream has suspended operations at an Oklahoma production facility that officials had previously connected to a foodborne illness linked to the deaths of three people . Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant the company's headquarters in Brenham, Texas . The now-recalled ice cream product - cups of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla - is not sold in retail locations and is shipped in bulk to 'institutional accounts' such as hospitals in 23 states that comprise less than 5 per cent of the company's sales. 'We recommend that consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products made at the company's Oklahoma facility and that retailers and institutions do not sell or serve them,' the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said late Friday. Ten products recalled earlier in March were from a production line at a plant in Brenham, Texas, the company's headquarters. The recall, the first in the company's 108-year history, began when five patients at Via Christi St. Francis hospital in Wichita, Kansas, became ill with listeriosis while hospitalized at some point from December 2013 to January 2015. Officials determined at least four drank milkshakes that contained Blue Bell ice cream. Three of the patients later died. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, according to the CDC. Listeriosis, also known as listeria, is a life-threatening infection caused by eating food contaminated with bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes . The disease primarily affects pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The CDC also said Friday that it has identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 that was indistinguishable from that found in the 3-ounce cup ice cream product traced to the Oklahoma plant. Four of the six patients were hospitalized in Texas for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis, according to the CDC. The one patient for whom information is available reported eating ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis and the Texas Department of State Health Services reported the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups, the CDC said. The 'investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing,' the CDC said. Blue Bell said it will conduct a 'careful and complete examination' of its Oklahoma plant 'to determine the exact cause of the contamination.' The company says it voluntarily shut down the plant, then notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . 'Once our investigation is complete and we have made all necessary improvements, it will return to operation,' according to the company's statement. 'Our other plants continue to operate and supply our products to retail stores and institutional customers.' The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been notified of the company's decision to voluntarily shut down the plant, Blue Bell said. In addition to the Broken Arrow plant, the company has two plants in Brenham and one in Sylacauga, Alabama.

6339,326b9c501b6f7c77e1647faced6a868d09ddf451,"The seeds of the Josh Meekings furore were planted during an otherwise unremarkable match between Hibernian and Dundee in the early weeks of 2013. Easter Road striker Gary Deegan caught Dens defender Gary Irvine high on his right shin in a dangerous challenge. Referee Craig Charleston saw an incident, but not the gory details. The official had his view obstructed by bodies and because of that the SFA could take no action. The governing body immediately took the stance they *should* be allowed to use video evidence to review incidents the referee had clearly missed. They altered the rules. Rules over use of video evidence to retrospectively ban players changed after this challenge by Gary Deegan (right) on Gary Irvine . PFA Scotland chief executive Fraser Wishart disagreed, telling them so. And on Thursday night he renewed his call for member clubs to put the genie back in the bottle amidst widespread unease at the fact Meekings might have missed a Scottish Cup Final because a referee and his assistants failed to see a handball in last Sunday’s semi-final victory over Celtic. Retrospective action, believes the Scottish players’ union, has become too far reaching. Its tentacles now stretch to an uncomfortable distance. ‘The referee had a clear view of it but couldn’t see the actual contact because of the two players’ bodies,’ said Wishart of the critical Deegan and Irvine incident two years ago. ‘When the SFA told us they were considering changing the regulation to allow the use of video evidence, we were strongly against it. ‘Under the rules, they couldn’t charge Gary Deegan because the referee was the wrong side of the incident. They moved to change that. ‘But as has been proven with Meekings, it was opening a whole can of worms as you are effectively re-refereeing the games. Inverness defender Josh Meekings clearly used his hand to stop the ball in the Scottish Cup semi-final . ‘We warned this was too far and it would cause problems.’ Wishart takes no pleasure in being vindicated by the decision of the independent appeal panel which lifted a one-game suspension on Inverness player Meekings on Thursday. Under the existing rules, SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan was within his rights to charge the player. He had denied Celtic a goalscoring opportunity with his hand. The officials had missed it and, reviewing the video evidence, the governing body believed it was a red-card offence punishable retrospectively. Echoing the views of FIFA vice president Jim Boyce and others, however, Wishart believes the rules have gone too far. That the authority of referees is now being undermined for matters it shouldn’t be. ‘The purpose of video evidence is not to catch minor things,’ he continued. ‘No player has a problem with anyone getting caught giving a fly punch or kick off the ball. They know they deserve it. ‘I know the referees are not happy with this because Steven McLean is being examined after the game. ‘He made a mistake - but does he deserve the continued fall-out from that? I don’t think referees, players or fans want it. Now FIFA don’t want it, either. ‘We have moved now towards re-refereeing the game. Steven McLean did have a view of the incident on Sunday, even if he didn’t see the handball. ‘If something happens behind a referee’s back – a fly kick – that’s not re-refereeing it because the referee genuinely doesn’t see it. ‘But when referees have a view of it it’s different. ‘Steven McLean was in the ideal position to see it. ‘The rule was brought in primarily for things that happen behind the referee’s back - but he and Alan Muir had a view of this. ‘Their vision might have been blocked - but there are angles where they are looking at it with no players between them. ‘The fact is that we all make mistakes and funnily enough the biggest supporter for the referee in all of this will be the players. ‘They will be annoyed, they will be angry. Players know what it’s like to make a mistake. Meekings has been cleared to play after SFA had banned him after deeming the hand ball a red card offence . ‘It’s a major mistake and that should be dealt with in terms of referee’s observer and their markings. But you can’t re-referee a game. ‘We react to one incident - and what happened here was a reaction to Gary Deegan. ‘The immediate reaction is to change the rules so it can’t happen again. ‘But we can’t just be reacting to one single incident – it has to be wider than that. ‘No one has a problem with penalising violent conduct. The SFA have to listen to everyone within the game.’ Wishart’s issues with events on Sunday extend beyond the Meekings scenario. Inverness defender Gary Warren missed last year’s League Cup Final after contracting two bookings en route. Agonisingly, he suffered the same fate at Parkhead last weekend. In contrast with Meekings, he *will* miss another final against Falkirk under the punitive two strikes rule. ‘There is an element of fairness when it comes to being banned from cup finals, as well,’ added Wishart. ‘Does Gary Warren deserve to miss out due to two bookings? ‘If you’re sent off for violent conduct it’s different, but it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity and for a player to miss it due to two yellows or a soft red seems like injustice to me. It needs to be looked at.’","Scottish PFA chief believes retrospective action is too far reaching .

From getting stopped and searched for drugs in Mexico, to hijacking tuk tuks in India, the fun-loving broker has had many adventures beyond London's exclusive SW3 postcode. While you may expect him to enjoy the best luxury hotels around the world, the carefree traveller says he often packs the bare minimum and even enjoys staying in the odd Travelodge. Jetsetter: Andy Jordan from Made In Chelsea has enjoyed the best hotels around the world, but also enjoys a stay at Travelodge . Sat in Andy's London flat at the start of the bank holiday a travel edition of 'Would You Rather' kicks off proceedings. 'I don't think I've played this sober before,' he says, before revealing how he prefers action holidays to lying on a beach. 'I once took a girl on holiday to Morocco for her birthday,' he said when asked about the most romantic place he has taken a female companion. 'It was a bit awkward as we were together but broke up just before, but both still wanted to go. 'What she didn't realise is I had booked it based on the best surfing spots in the area and turned up at the airport with my surfboard. 'She was livid!' Action man! The singer loves to keep active on holiday and aims to surf in the Arctic one day . The singer released his album, Geography, last year and in the title song he sings about falling in love at first sight on London's Underground. The ladies of London will be delighted to know he is completely open to finding love on trains. 'I had my first 'train encounter' when I was 14 and I chatted to this girl for five hours, all the way from Oxford to Bodmin Parkway,' he explains. 'It was so incredible we even kissed when I got off and met up that evening on the beach. 'I am a big believer in that kind of thing.' Sun loving! The latest holiday the Chelsea boy went on involved the cast from the TV series. Their trip to Barbados was shown on the season opening episode this week . Most of the singer's future holiday plans involve ticking surfing spots off his bucket list. 'I want to surf in the Arctic, it's becoming a big thing and you can surf between glaciers with Patagonia wetsuits that let you go in four degree water.' Of course the Chelsea boy had a gap year, funded by doing a telesales job in his bedroom in pajamas, before surfing every day for six months around the world. When asked if he would rather join the Mile High Club and be caught or never join at all, his response is instant. 'Join it! Hands down! Just to clarify I am not currently a member of it.' Andy's favourite hotel is the Tryall Club in Jamaica. He stayed at the Round House and brought the whole of his family . His favourite place to stay is in the Tryall Club in Jamaica's Montego Bay. The country club retreat is where he has previously shared the sumptuous Round House property with his family. 'It's very cool as it has a huge turret and a dining room table that seats 18 people and the staff are amazing. 'I got blamed for drinking all the rum but it was actually the butler.' Andy also loves to check into London hotels such as the Corinthia, just for fun (as you do) and the Londoner believes the hotel service in the capital is among the best in the world. More rivalry! Andy Jordan and Jamie Laing set their sights on Made In Chelsea newcomer Jess Woodley . But it's not all sumptuous surroundings and butler service, Andy reveals he is also a fan of Travelodge. 'When I was on tour I took our whole team there and they do a great bed,' he said. 'Even Mark Francis would stay there, he is actually an extremely chilled traveller.' If the singer could pick anywhere in the world to busk for a day, it would be Union Square in New York in summer. 'I probably wouldn't get to play for very long as I would get chatting to someone, go for a coffee and end up exploring the city. 'Actually, an hour outside Wall Street and you would have about $400 and could leave it there anyway!' If Andy could take one of the Made In Chelsea stars on a desert island with him it would be Jamie. 'He would freak the most for sure, but he's such a positive person he would just think screw it and have a fun time. 'He's not a fan of organised fun so this would be the perfect place for him, but he would definitely start freaking out with then sun went down.' The TV series is on its ninth season, and can be seen on E4 on Mondays at 9pm . Hijacking tuk tuks! Just one of Andy's many holiday adventures when he has been outside of his London SW postcode . The Chelsea star enjoys going abroad as he is less recognised and does not have to act in such a refined way. 'In India I said to one of the tuk tuk drivers that I would pay extra if I could drive. 'It was a really great way of getting back from the temple to our hotel. 'But it was night and I nearly hit a cow, which are sacred there, and I had to swerve to miss it and a couple of people fell out!' His latest holiday was with the Made in Chelsea gang, and they flew with British Airways  from London Gatwick to Barbados. The gorgeous stars' holiday was shown on the season opening on Monday this week and Andy was clearly a fan of the company.

It was given as a gift to two sisters who worked as servants for the Nightingale family at Lea Hurst, near Matlock, Derbyshire. Dating back to around 1840, the 10in tall lamp will go under the hammer at Hansons in Etwall, Derbyshire, on June 26. After her experiences in the war Nightingale returned to Derbyshire, where she had spent her childhood, in the 1850s. She wrote of what she had seen in the conflict with her 1859 Notes on Nursing still considered as having shaped the profession today. During the war she became known as The Lady with the Lamp thanks to a report in The Times. She had been sent to Selimiye Barracks in Scutari, now Istanbul, in 1854 to care for soldiers. She pleaded with the British newspaper to appeal to the Government for better working conditions having been horrified by the squalor and disease fighters faced. The result was Renkioi Hospital, a civilian facility built in England and shipped to the area to care for those who had been hurt. It was there Nightingale earned her nickname, carrying a lamp as she completed rounds of the hospital's patients through the night. The lamp from her Derbyshire home was passed down through generations of the Lea Hurst servants' family. Auctineer Charles Hanson said: ‘The lamp is quite remarkable. It has a wonderful provenance, which confirms it helped ignite Florence and her writings late into many a Derbyshire night. 'Such an iconic object and it’s association with such a leading lady will be guided at £1000-2000. With interest and competition it may just ignite, since it is such a wonderful object.'

11417,da39f68c5d9a413e0759fc6bff8260f76ed1ac59,"Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with his latest column for Sportsmail. The Barnet manager talks about how important it is for the troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. TAKING THE BISCUIT . Just a few days ago an old friend of mine Jimmy Carter, the winger who played for Millwall, Liverpool and Arsenal not the US President, visited Barnet and left me a nice packet of milk chocolate biscuits in my office. After training, to help me get rid of them, I decided to give some out to our players. The first seven who walked past my office door were called in for a cup of PG Tips and a chat. I asked each one to take a biscuit and pass the pack on, around the group. I kept repeating it, each time: Take one and pass it on, take one and pass it on. One player didn’t want a biscuit and simply passed the packet on. Martin Allen believes it is important for troops to follow order during this crucial stage of the season. I stopped them in their tracks and asked him why he hadn’t taken a biscuit. This was an opportunity to point out how important it is to follow the coach’s direction. I didn’t tell them to eat it - I told them to take one and pass the pack on. The other six were looking at their biscuits waiting for the go ahead. I passed the packet back to the player and he now took his biscuit. I let them all know they could eat if they like, and if not return it to my desk, and shook all their hands as they left the room. When it comes to this crucial stage in the season, you need all your troops ready to follow orders. IT’S A ZAYN IF THEY’RE NOT PULLING IN ONE DIRECTION . At whatever level it’s always important to have all your players going in One Direction. Just like the band, if you’ve got one person wanting to go a different way, do a different thing, something is going to crack and the team ethic and unity will be broken. At the business end of the season, it is so important that they are working as a team. People have to do their jobs; defending set plays, defensive shape when you’re attacking, working up and down the pitch. You need good captains and leaders within your group. People like John Terry, who not only does his job but also makes sure each and every person in that Chelsea squad follows Jose Mourinho’s guidance out on the pitch. It is One Direction, or no direction. Captain John Terry works hard to ensure everybody at Chelsea is heading in the same direction . ON THE PERIPHERY . Having good players in your first team is obviously vitally important. But the players out of the team, on the periphery, can lose you matches. Negative body language, people unable to cope with not playing, disruptive comments, and a dismissive look about everything you say and do can infect the whole squad. The man-management of these players on the edge of the first team is crucial and the skills needed they do not teach you on the UEFA Pro Licence or courses put on by the Football Association. I’ve spent the last three-and-a-half years working with a guy called Rob Northfield, who runs Inspire based up in Harrogate, on man-management skills for my players, my staff and of course myself. He deals with chief executives of the infamous banks and building societies. Allen won a championship with Gillingham and is hoping to soon do the same with Barnet . Since then, I have one championship in the bag at Gillingham and hopefully by the end of this month would’ve bagged a second. Without Rob Northfields this would not have happened. Mourinho is a coach who is so good at dealing with players who are on the bench and not always in the side. He knows at some point in the season he will need them and they are always fighting for him. Players on the periphery can make the difference between winning and losing. Allen’s Analysis… . One person I keep hearing about… Gary Rowett Gary Rowett is winning so many games and doing so well at Birmingham City. He has steered them in the right direction after their poor start to the season in the Championship. He did a tremendous job at Burton Albion and back then there was no doubt in my mind, having played against his teams over the last couple of years, he would go on to manage at a much higher level. He must've asked me at least one hundred questions when my Gillingham team visited Burton the week after winning the championship. He was like Bamber Gascoigne, the old University Challenge presenter - non-stop firing questions at me. He was listening to the answers and asking intelligent questions about how we managed to win the league with Gillingham from a team that had previously been mid-table. For me, he’s heading for the top. Allen believes Birmingham City manager Gary Rowett is going to go all the way to the top . One thing I’d change about… perceptions in football . At Barnet last summer, I found myself with no staff and a need to recruit new people. I took on Jon Nurse, born in Barbados, as a player-coach. I was impressed when he told me how when he was a teenager he lost his mum and he had the responsibility to bring up his younger brother. On top of that he got a degree in computer networking and played more than 300 league games, winning a promotion, the FA Trophy and been in numerous playoff finals. He also has a UEFA B coaching licence and a schoolboy skills training academy called Love The Ball. I took on another player-coach, goalkeeper Graham Stack, an Irishman, who has four impeccably behaved children, who runs the Graham Stack Soccer Academy for youngsters and a high-end executive travel company with his wife, who can build patios and brick walls alongside his UEFA B coaching licence. Former Arsenal goalkeeper Graham Stack has been working alongside Allen as a coach at Barnet . Then I was introduced to a young man called Omar Yabroudi who moved to London from Dubai and wanted to be my analyst. He works hard and has been a real help. He works for virtually nothing and has fitted in superbly. We have a 23-year-old female physiotherapist, Jade Cook, who had only worked with our youth team before but she has stepped up to work with the first team for the first time. She is calm, quiet, well-organised, disciplined, structured and I am very happy all the players are being so well looked after. I did not take on a Barbadian, an Irishman, an Emirati or a female because of their nationality, or skin colour or gender. I took them on because they’re good at their jobs, they are good people, with good personalities and they have excellent characters. I’m very proud of all of them in their first year working for me and no doubt all four will go on to work at the top level in the Premier League. Without them we would not have been top of the Conference for so long. The big issue… England coming out of the dark ages. When I was a little boy watching England versus Poland in the front room with my dad, the amazing Jan Tomaszewski, who Brian Clough called a ‘clown in gloves,’ stopped England qualifying for the 1974 World Cup with his heroic performance in goal. The panel of pundits, all those years ago, said we’ve got to change. We’re not playing the type of football other countries play; our children don’t get coached to be good technical players like other nations. Over the years I’ve heard it time and time again. The same old stuff. Especially over the last few years with the Spanish dominance, people asking why we have not got the Iniestas and Xavis of this world on our shores. Allen believes Greg Dyke is the man to help find the Iniestas and Xavis of the English game . The Football Association’s technical director now, Dan Ashworth, appointed by my old chairman Greg Dyke, is a forward-thinker who can finally make some changes. He may never have played a professional game in his life, but at West Bromwich Albion he implemented a modern football structure at the club, where the manager does not have to deal with everything, where other departments and professionals are involved. Greg Dyke speaks to Premier League chief Richard Scudamore ahead of his FA council meeting . Ashworth can handle himself well. At a League Managers Association training day a couple of years, at a hotel near Reading, one Sunday afternoon, speaking just before Fabio Capello, Ashworth faced a roomful of sceptical, old-fashioned managers that thought they knew best and thought they knew the way forward. The gave him a torrid time with their caveman-like mentality that the manager should run the whole club. He handled the room carefully and skilfully and I think Greg Dyke has put English football into the right hands. He is the right man to take England back for their second World Cup win.","Martin Allen believes it's a crucial time for troops to follow orders .

1845,5a0fc5446164c69f250c817608999785dbfd635c,"A university undergraduate has claimed that the cost of trying to study in London left her with no other choice than to turn to prostitution. As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than £1,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work– even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman – who asked to remain anonymous – spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn £7 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about £100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London . 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'","A student has revealed she turned to sex work to cover the cost of living and studying in London .

7039,e0899e1b017634c66815988009ca2513fc33b2d5,"The reserve deputy who shot a suspect dead after firing his gun instead of his Taser was investigated in 2009 over his questionable training and erratic behavior in the field. Robert Bates, 73, appeared in Tulsa district court on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to second-degree manslaughter over the death of Eric Harris, who was killed during a botched sting on April 2. Since the incident there have been allegations Bates was not properly trained and it is now emerged that when previously confronted by other deputies over his behavior, he told them he could do whatever he wanted. Scroll down for video . Heading to court: Robert Bates, left, is seen walking to court on Tuesday morning with his attorney Corbin Brewster, right, before he entered his not-guilty plea in the death of Eric Harris earlier this month . 'Mistake': The 73-year-old reserve deputy claims he mistakenly pulled out his gun instead of his Taser and shot dead the man as he fled the scene of an undercover operation on April 2 . In 2009, the Tulsa Sheriff's Office concluded after an internal investigation that Bates had received special treatment during training and while working as a reserve deputy, CBS News reports. The investigation found that other deputies raised concerns about Bates' behavior in the field, almost from the start of his tenure. He was said to have used his personal car while on duty and made unauthorized vehicle stops. The inquiry came to the conclusion that high-ranking officers created an atmosphere where employees were intimidated about reporting violations of department policy. Dan Smolen, the attorney for Eric Harris, claimed that if the investigation's findings had been acted on in 2009 Harris might still be alive. He told CBS News: 'I think there are so many people who look on at so much corruption it's more than just a couple of people.' Charged: Bates (left in his mug shot) shot Harris (pictured right) and faces four years in prison if convicted . A spokesman for the Tulsa Sheriff acknowledged that some type of internal review was conducted, but that there was no further action taken. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said this week he believes that Bates received his required training. Bates, a Tulsa County volunteer, shot Harris, 44, after the man was confronted during an undercover gun-sale operation and ran past him. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after Harris. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the disturbing clip, which was released by the sheriff's office, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him! I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded father can be heard saying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' Earlier this week the Harris family expressed their anger after learning that retired insurance executive Bates, who is out on $25,000 bond, would be allowed to take a month-long vacation to the Bahamas. A statement released by the family read: 'Whether intended or not, Mr. Bates' vacationing in the Bahamas at this time sends a message of apathy with respect to the shooting and Eric's life,' they said. Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' 'At a time when we are still mourning the death of a loved one that he shot down in the street, Mr. Bates will be relaxing and enjoying his wealth and privilege.' It is not clear when he is leaving for the holiday but Bates will next appear in court on July 2. He has previously visited the Bahamas with the sheriff, Stanley Glanz, and another reserve deputy and paid for part of Glanz's trip. In separate news conferences on Monday, the county sheriff and lawyers for Harris' family disagreed on whether the reserve officer should have been allowed to conduct police work. Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Bates, his long-time insurance agent and former campaign manager, had been properly trained and passed annual firearms certifications required by the state. Dan Smolen, the lawyer for Harris' family, said the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office violated a number of its internal policies by letting Bates carry his personal handgun after training with another weapon. Smolen also said the department failed to keep a permanent record of Bates' training, in violation of local policies. Records Bates released during the weekend showed that the volunteer officer was trained on a .45, not the weapon used in Harris' death. Bates, who sold his insurance business for $6 million in 1999, was trained to be a Tulsa Police Department patrolman in 1964 but left in 1965. He was out of law enforcement for 35 years, returning for volunteer work in Florida in 2000 before joining the Tulsa County force in 2008 and making a number of donations to the agency. He also was Glanz's campaign manager during the 2012 election. Anger: Harris' son Aidan Fraley (pictured right with his uncle Andre Harris a week after his father's death), has said the police officers who allowed Bates to become a cop should be held accountable for his death . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . During an appearance on the Today show last week, he apologized to Harris' family. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' He also insisted that, despite keeping his gun and Taser on different parts of his uniform, it was easy to confuse the two. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates said. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' Harris' son responded by saying that the volunteer deputy was too old to be on the police force. 'He should have been in a retirement home, not out there on the scene killing my dad,' Aidan Fraley said, NBC reported.

6646,f2b57ae4351196a4e60c0f5f0742eecbaa983345,"A teacher in New Jersey who assigned her third-grade class to write 'get well' letters to a sick inmate convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer was suspended Friday, the school superintendent said. Orange School Superintendent Ronald Lee said in a statement that school administrators 'vehemently deny' any knowledge of Marilyn Zuniga's assignment. Preliminary inquiries found that Zuniga did not seek approval from administrators nor were parents notified, Lee said. The letters were delivered to Mumia Abu-Jamal in prison following his hospitalization last month for what his family said was treatment for complications from diabetes. Suspended: Marilyn Zuniga (left), a teacher at Forest Street School in Orange, New Jersey (right), controversially had her third graders write letters to Mumia Abu-Jamal and then sent them to the cop killer as he was recovering in hospital from collapsing in prison. She has now been suspended without pay, pending an investigation . Ill: Mumia's supporters say photos of the prison journalist released this week by his wife show how ill and frail he is. Untreated diabetes is said to be the reason for Abu-Jama's hospitalization last week, but he has since been released . The former Black Panther is serving life behind bars for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he is the victim of a racist justice system. A supporter and history professor at Baruch College, Johanna Fernandez, brought him the letters. She posted on her Facebook page that 'he chuckled as he read excerpts from these touching letters'. Abu-Jamal was released from a hospital in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, on April 1, and returned to the prison, she said. The school district was closed for spring break and the superintendent said a full investigation would begin when classes resume on Monday. Zuniga will remain suspended without pay until the investigation is completed, the superintendent said. Additional action could be taken by the school board once the investigation is finished. An email The Associated Press sent Zuniga seeking comment was not immediately returned. A second batch of students, from the  the Philadelphia Student Union, also sent Abu-Jama letters. 'Get well soon': Third graders in Orange, New Jersey, and high school students in the Philadelphia Student Union have sent Mumia Abu-Jamal letters wishing him well after he was hospitalized last week . Delivery: Johanna Fernandez (right), a professor of history at Baruch College, delivered Mumia Abu-Jamal a batch of letters from two different schools in hospital. He is pictured here also with (from left) Abdu Jon and Pam Africa . 'We shared a touching moment with Mumia in an effort to raise his spirits,' Fernandez reported. 'Two teachers delivered letters to us that their students had written to Mumia.' 'It had been a long time since we had seen Mumia smile.' A picture of some of the letters appeared online, however it is unclear what they actually said. However the fact they were written and then presented to Abu-Jamal has infuriated many. Richard Costello, political coordinator for the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police, said the letters set a dangerous example. 'I think it's both alarming and outrageous that any teacher would use a group of innocent seven-year-olds to promote a twisted agenda glorifying murder, glorifying hatred and glorifying violence,' Costello told Fox News. 'He shot (the officer) in the back and then as the officer lay slumped against a wall helpless he leaned over and shot him between the eyes. 'When he was in the hospital he actually bragged about it.' Costello said all the teachers involved in the letter writing campaign should be fired. 'Furthermore all the parents who have children in that school system need to reevaluate that involvement, because these children are now placed in danger by the very people charged with their education,' Costello said. 'They are being used as tools in someone's twisted agenda.' Hospitalized: Convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal was placed in the critical care unit of a Pennsylvania hospital last week after collapsing in prison . Costello has previously described Abu-Jamal as 'the devil'. Abu-Jamal is thought to have collapsed in prison due to high blood sugar levels. Attorney Bret Grote with the Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center said last week that his client was placed in the critical care unit of Schuylkill Medical Center in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Grote says neither he nor Abu-Jamal's brother, Keith Cook, had been allowed in to see him. 'We're concerned, about as concerned as it gets, about Mumia's health,' Grote told the Philadelphia Inquirer. A Pennsylvania Department of Corrections official also declined to provide details. A spokesman for Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center says he had no information about Abu-Jamal. 'We never discuss an inmate's medical condition,' deputy press secretary Susan Bensinger told the Inquirer. Mumia's hospitalization was revealed Monday when a group of his friends arrived to the State Correctional Institution at Mahanoy for a visit and were informed by prison staff that he wasn't there. While Grote and others had permission with the prison to visit Mumia, the hospital had not yet cleared them. Grote said he hoped the matter would be cleared up by Tuesday. Abu-Jamal is a former Black Panther serving life in prison for the 1981 murder of white Philadelphia police Officer Daniel Faulkner. Treated: Lawyers with Pittsburgh-based Abolitionist Law Center say prison officials told them Mumia was being treated last week at Pottsville's Schuylkill Medical Center (pictured). He has since been released . His conviction was upheld through years of appeals, but he has gained international support for his claim that he's the victim of a racist justice system. Mumia's death sentence was overturned in 2012. Abu-Jamal supporters include celebrities like Whoopi Goldberg, and many hail him as a revolutionary. Abu-Jamal has written several books, hosted his own radio show and even has a street named after him in France.

7342,999c2445df28282e5217336c306e7a1e293bbd1d,"(CNN)Here's a pop quiz: What's better for America's status in the world? A) Being a global leader in innovation, job creation, education, social mobility, literacy and child health. B) Being a global leader in imprisoning the highest number of human beings -- its own citizens. It's an obvious answer. But the unfortunate reality is that the United States leads the world in incarceration, not education. Our country has shown time and again a nearly unlimited capacity to reinvent itself and move closer to the ideals on which our society was founded. Yet we have emerged as the global leader in a race that no nation would want to even be a contender in. While our country is home to only 5% of the world's total population, we are home to 25% of the world's prison population. And nearly three fourths of this population is comprised of nonviolent offenders. At the same time, we are losing the increasingly important race to educate our citizens. Where the United States was once ranked first in high school graduation rates, we now rank 23rd in high school completion among 30 of the world's most developed nations. Where we were once the driving force of the global economy, we now rank fifth in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness index. Key metrics in this index include the quality of a nation's primary, secondary and higher education systems. Instead of empowering the next generation of American artists, scientists, engineers, inventors and entrepreneurs, our country has chosen to devote a massive amount of resources, time and energy to locking people up. By imprisoning individuals, we also burden families, condemn generations to cycles of poverty and breed economic inequality. In the 1980s and 1990s, Congress chose to adopt laws that drastically changed the way our country handled nonviolent drug crimes. Since then, the American prison population has increased by nearly 800% over the past 30 years. Over 2.7 million American children have a parent who is incarcerated, and 10 million American children at one time in their lives had a parent in prison. Americans of color are disproportionately burdened by the failures of our justice system. There are more black men in prison or under state or federal supervision today than there were enslaved in 1850. And while African Americans make up only 13.6% of the total U.S. population, they make up a whopping 40.2% of the U.S. prison population. The sad reality is that in today's America, prisoners are never truly free from the burdens of our criminal justice system. A report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research concluded that once released from prison, an ex-offender's prospects for obtaining employment statistically decreased. The report estimated that, in 2008, ex-offender employment losses cost our economy the equivalent of 1.5 to 1.7 million workers, or $57 billion to $65 billion annually. It's therefore no surprise that American prisons have become revolving doors, with two out of every three former offenders rearrested within three years of their release. The millions of wives, sisters, husbands, daughters, sons, friends and the people they love who have been incarcerated are burdened disproportionately by an outdated, archaic and overly punitive system. These millions of Americans have the ability to advance our country, our economy and our global competitiveness. They just need to be given the opportunity. American taxpayers aren't free from the burdens of our criminal justice system either. In addition to the billions lost in jobs and productivity, Americans spend over a quarter of a trillion dollars each year to keep millions of nonviolent, low-level offenders imprisoned. The price tag is truly staggering. It costs on average $29,000 a year to house one inmate at the federal level. In contrast, our country spends a little over $11,000 dollars a year per elementary school student.  Imagine the good we could do if we could re-appropriate those tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money and economic losses away from imprisonment and toward investment in our children's future. We must start to deconstruct the perverse order of our priorities and build a more just society by making needed changes at the federal level. We must examine the way our criminal justice system works -- or rather, doesn't -- and take the necessary actions to change it. Fortunately, there is already a road map for successfully addressing these problems. We know reforms will work because they already are in states across the country. In both blue states such as New Jersey and Connecticut and red states such as Texas and Georgia, state and local officials have developed and instituted sweeping reforms that have reduced their prison populations and crime rates. They are succeeding by focusing their efforts on areas where the criminal justice system most needs reform. We should follow their example on the federal level. First, we should pass legislation that promotes ""front end"" reform, such as ending mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent drug crimes. Secondly, we should pass legislation that enacts ""behind the wall"" reforms, such as eradicating the cruel practice of juvenile solitary confinement. And thirdly, we should enact ""back end"" reforms with legislation that assists in sealing criminal records and removing barriers to employment for nonviolent formerly incarcerated people. As we reform our criminal justice system at the national level, we will alter the cycles of poverty and recidivism that plague too many American communities and start to develop virtuous cycles of excellence. Instead of putting resources toward juvenile detention centers, we can put resources toward afterschool programs that have proved to help keep kids out of the juvenile justice system and in school. Instead of losing valuable contributors to our economy because of their status as ex-offenders, we can develop apprenticeship and training programs that improve worker skills and jump start our economy. Instead of asking American taxpayers to pay for warehousing people who commit nonviolent, low-level, crimes, we can make sure that students of all ages have access to math, science and technology schooling that will help them excel in the workforce and as productive members of society. Let's devote our resources to empowering our citizens, not imprisoning them. Let's choose to raise our expectations as a country, and let's meet them.","Cory Booker: The unfortunate reality is that the United States leads the world in incarceration, not education .

Kim Sears wore a somber expression as she saw her husband-to-be Andy Murray lose to Novak Djokovic in yesterday's Men's Final at the Miami Open Crandon Park Tennis Center in Key Biscayne, Florida . High-street loving Kim opted for one of her go-to brands, Whistles for the V-neck, short-sleeved dress, which comes in at £110. Kim accompanied her sophisticated dress with a sombre expression as she witnessed Djokovic beat Andy again, taking home his fifth Miami Open title in Key Biscayne, making her black outfit a fitting choice. However this was not the first time Kim had opted for the dark colour while topping up her wedding tan. On April 3 Kim watched Murray, 27, beat Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic in their semi-final match in a high necked black mini dress accompanied with her trusty Ray-ban glasses and straw hat. And on 31 March Kim showcased her golden glow and a glowing smile in an ASOS off-the-shoulder dress as she witnessed Andy Murray play against South African Kevin Anderson in their fourth round match. Despite yesterday's defeat Andy and Kim are sure to have their smiles back soon as the will tie the knot at Dunblane Cathedral on April 11 and not, as anticipated, in the tiny chapel at his Cromlix House Hotel, near the Perthshire town where he grew up. The 27-year-old opted for a black mini dress for the third time during the Men's Final of the Miami Open . Kim chose a zip front dress costing £110 from one of her high street favourites Whistles on April 5 . For the 27-year-old’s many fans and friends in the town, it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck – so they too could toast his big day. The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray’s uncle Niall Erskine said: ‘I’m sure it will be a popular decision, as he’s had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Hopefully Kim will cheer up soon as she is due to marry Andy Murray next week on April 11 . Andy Murray was defeated by long-term rival Novak Djokovic who took home his fifth Miami Open title . ‘Andy is looking forward to bringing all his family and friends to Dunblane. I’m sure lots of people will come down to see the cars as they go past and it will be a very popular day.’ The cathedral’s minister, the Rev Colin Renwick, said: ‘I can’t confirm anything as we have a strict rule that we cannot discuss anyone’s wedding. ‘Wherever the wedding will be, there is excitement because there is a great deal of affection for Andy in Dunblane and a great deal of pride in him. I think people are genuinely very pleased for him.’ The couple announced their engagement in November after nine years together. Murray has said he may have three best men; his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier. It is believed Miss Sears will have four bridesmaids. Kim opted for a very similar outfit on day nine of the Miami open pairing her favourite straw hat and sunglasses with an ASOS off-the-shoulder mini dress . And on April 3 Kim was seen in her favourite ensemble once more as she watched her husband-to-be defeat Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic in the semi-finals .","Kim Sears  watched Novak Djokovic defeat Andy Murray at the Miami Open .

10642,57c28e2bef33d1bb2b37048ebfb7b7977916ca07,"Two Maryland parents whose hands-off 'free-range' parenting got their children picked up by police yet again on Sunday are now vowing to file a lawsuit. Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their son Rafi, 10, and daughter Dvora, 6, roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs, both of them scientists, say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a ointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent’s reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. ‘They kept the kids for hours,’ a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. ‘It’s 10:30 at night. They’ve been missing since 6 o’clock…Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn’t call us.’ According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . ‘The policeman said “We’ll give you a ride home” when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said “I’ll bring you home” and, instead, he brought us here.’ 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . ‘They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I’m not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.","Police seized Rafi, 10, and Dvora, 6, in a Maryland park on Sunday and their parents say they weren't reunited by CPS for hours .

According to police Mr Docherty hired the victim to complete concrete works at his property. A man has admitted to ripping another man’s scrotum with a metal hook after he thought a concreting job wasn’t up to scratch . At around 3.30pm on March 17 Mr Docherty was agitated when he returned to find the work wasn’t carried out to his specifications. At the time, the victim was not on the work site but a contractor told Mr Docherty he would be back shortly. He told the contractor he would rip the man’s penis off. Once the victim returned, the two men got in a heated argument.

5824,35da836d682f6a82a9889296a89fcbd853cc2309,"Attorneys for two sides agree that in April 1995, a 24-year-old man who had been pointed out by a Southern California college student as her rapist had his truck rear-ended before he was kidnapped, brutally beaten and killed. Where they differ is on the role of now-45-year-old Gianni Van in the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez, whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of a road. At the opening of his trial Wednesday, prosecutors said Van was enraged after his ex-girlfriend Norma Patricia Esparza told him Ramirez had raped her and he must be held responsible for the attack. She's expected to testify Thursday. Accused: Gianni Van, 45, (left) is accused of the 1995 murder of f Gonzalo Ramirez (right), whose blindfolded, bloodied body was found on the side of an Irvine, California road having suffered 30 blows with a cleaver . Van's lawyer said his client had no knowledge of the plan to harm Ramirez and was threatened that he would suffer a similar fate if he snitched on a friend and friend's employee who carried out the killing. The case has drawn international attention since Esparza — who went on to become a psychology professor and moved to France — was arrested in 2012, provoking an outcry from sexual assault victim advocates who say the case sends a chilling message to rape survivors. During opening statements, Senior Deputy District Attorney Mike Murray showed graphic photos of Ramirez's blindfolded, mangled body lying on the side of the road in a pool of blood. 'Gonzalo Ramirez was targeted, and he was targeted by somebody who was going to make sure he suffered,' Murray said. 'Whether Norma Esparza was sexually assaulted or not, for our purposes today, doesn't matter. What matters is she told the defendant that.' Revenge? Prosecutors say Van killed Ramirez as revenge for raping his on-and-off girlfriend Norma Esparza (pictured). Esparza and Van allegedly entered into a sham marriage before Van's original arrest for the crime. Esparza could not be forced to testify and Van was released. They divorced and Esparza went on to become a psychology professor in France and the mother of a little girl . Arrested: In 2012, Esparza was arrested in connection to the slaying when she re-entered the United States for an academic conference . Prosecutors say Ramirez was taken to the transmission shop of his friend Kody Tran, where he was blindfolded, chained up and beaten. They say he was found having suffered 30 blows from a meat cleaver, reports the Orange County Register. The prosecution alleges Van was aided by Tran and Tran's wife Diane Tran as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries. His body was found dumped on the side of a road in Irvine. 'It was beyond horrific,' Murray said. 'It was the act of an incredibly angry man...The defendant was out of his mind with anger.' 'He felt that he had been violated,' Murray said of Van. Van is charged with murder during the commission of a kidnapping. If convicted, he could get life in prison without the possibility of parole. Kody Tran died when he killed himself in an unrelated July 2013 standoff with police. His wife Diane has taken a plea deal and was expected to testify against Van. Shannon Gries still faces murder charges. After the killing, Van and Esparza — who had been questioned by police — entered into a sham marriage to avoid prosecution, Murray said. While Van was arrested in 1996, he was released because Esparza could not be forced to testify against her husband, he said. Esparza later divorced Van. Esparza's husband, Jorge Mancillas, had said at a 2013 news conference that his wife had confided in Van about the rape and he took matters into his own hands. Involved? The prosecution alleges Van was aided by his friend Kody Tran (center)  and Tran's wife Diane Tran (right) as well as Tran's employee Shannon Gries (left). Kody Tran killed himself during an unrelated standoff with police in 2013. Diane Tran has taken a plea deal and will testify against Van. Shannon Gries awaits trial on murder charges . Van's lawyer, Jeremy Dolnick, said his client knew nothing of the plans to kidnap or kill Ramirez but was shown his severely beaten body strung up by chains at Tran's auto transmission shop and warned he would face the same fate if he ever snitched. 'He didn't ask anyone to kill anyone. He never had homicidal thoughts of revenge,' Dolnick told jurors, adding that Van had confided in Tran about Esparza's rape and that Tran and Gries took matters into their own hands. Esparza, 40, is now the mother of a little girl. She pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in an agreement with prosecutors last year. She is expected to receive a six-year sentence in exchange for testifying at the trials of Van and another defendant. A fourth defendant also pleaded guilty in a deal with prosecutors. Plea: Esparza, here in 2013, claims she was coerced by Van into pointing out her rapist in 1995.

9308,10bc54766c8de1b00769417a425345b2a46c1141,"Ask any Peruvian where the best place to party is and you'll always get the same reply: 'Puno!' The city's colourful fiestas, combining Spanish and Inca traditions, often last for days. During the fortnight-long Candlemas celebrations, dancers parade through the streets. Men dress as multi-coloured dragons or monsters, while local women, known as cholitas, wear skirts puffed up with petticoats and small bowler hats. Reeds all about it: Hand-crafted boats on the gentle surface of Lake Titicaca . Arriving in Puno, you wonder at first where on earth the inhabitants get their energy. This city of 100,000 souls on the shores of Lake Titicaca could leave you breathless for all the wrong reasons. Situated on a vast plateau in the Andes, at an altitude north of 13,000 ft, it is higher than any Alpine ski resort, and you need to go gently the first few days you're here. Hotels stock oxygen to revive tourists from soroche - altitude sickness - an affliction that causes shortness of breath, headaches and worse. But once acclimatised, you're in for a treat. Though its architecture is underwhelming (with the exception of a splendid central square), what entrances every visitor to Puno is Lake Titicaca. One of the world's largest lakes, and its highest navigable one, it stretches 110 miles by 38 miles across Peru and Bolivia. It is vast, remote, unworldly. The high peaks of the Andes frame it in the distance, some glistening with snow. There are more familiar sights, too. At the town's busy port, you'll see a gunboat called the Yavari, which has a distinctively British look. It was built in London in 1862, then transported, piece by piece, across the Andes to Puno, where it ferried people around for 70 years until the roads made it obsolete and it was left to rot. It was saved from the scrapheap by an English woman, Meriel Larken, who restored and turned it into a B&B. Local life: The ingenious floating Uros Islands in the middle of Lake Titicaca are made from totora reeds . The accommodation onboard is suitably nautical - you sleep in bunk beds. If you're not spending the night, for a small donation you can just tour the ship. The port is the gateway to Puno's fascinating islands. A standard, full-day tour will first take you to the Uros Islands, originally built by the Uru people as a way to escape rival tribes. These man-made floating structures are hewn from mats of totora reeds, which grow abundantly in the shallows of the lake. Secured to the bottom of the lake by ropes, as the layers at the bottom rot, new ones are added to the top to keep it dry and afloat. Stepping on them feels decidedly squidgy, as if you're treading on a giant waterbed. Uru women greet you dressed in wide-brimmed hats and brightly-coloured skirts. Islanders make the most of their income from tourists, so will invite you into their cosy, pointy-roofed huts, which smell of hay. The only hint of the 21st century? A television in the corner. After the Uros, the next port of call is an island in the conventional sense. Taquile, with its craggy, terraced hillsides dotted with sheep, is reminiscent of the Aegean Islands. It's around the same size as Sark in the Channel Islands and home to 1,700 people. A glimpse of traditional Peru: You can meet Uru islanders, and go inside their homes, on the lake . Like Sark, cars are banned here, but the island's elders also forbid beasts of burden, such as donkeys and horses, which leaves the locals to lug everything around on their backs. The other thing you'll notice is that the men all wear distinctive woollen hats, reminiscent of Victorian nightcaps. These denote their marital status - the tip of a bachelor's hat is white to signify it is unfinished. Knitting here is the preserve of men, who pass the tradition down from father to son. On marrying, a man may wear a totally red hat, to show that he, like his hat, is now complete. Early evening in Puno and the streets are abuzz. Head to the pedestrianised Calle Lima and a restaurant called La Casona. Here, you'll eat some of the city's best ceviche, the national dish of raw fish 'cooked' by being marinated in lime juice, a trend that has caught on in the UK. Being so close to the bountiful Lake Titicaca, Puno has some of Peru's best ceviche restaurants. Another excuse, as if you needed one, to visit this wonderful place.

The Ford van was seen on surveillance tape making its way to the roof of the garage where the woman was told she was going to die by men in ski masks unless she handed over the code for the jewelry store safe . The 53-year-old female employee of the National Watch and Diamond Exchange in downtown Philadelphia was leaving work earlier this month shortly before 4pm when she was pulled into a Ford van in a parking garage. She was driven to the building's roof, beaten and shot with a Taser seven times. She was told she was going to die by the three men in ski masks,Philly.com reported. According to authorities, the woman was told to hand over codes to the safe which she did not know. She handed over her ATM card, which the suspects used to fill the van with gas, and was taken to a cemetery where she was zip-tied and dumped from the van.

Do you find your mind wandering, caught in a day dream? Or hitting the afternoon slump ahead of schedule, loosing your train of thought even by mid-morning? If you struggle to stay alert, massage therapist Suzi Cinalli, from The Vital Touch, might have just the answer. Here, writing for Healthista, she outlines her six top tips to boost concentration, from cooing over cute pictures of  pets, to indulging in a lunchtime yoga session... Massage your 'third eye' Massaging reflex points when you have a spare moment at your desk can boost memory and dissolve tension. Apply pressure to your 'third eye' with your middle finger tip while taking several deep breaths. The 'third eye' is a point directly between your eyebrows at the point where the bridge of your nose meets your forehead. Press on this point to 3-4 minutes, repeating two or three times a day. The 'third eye' is associated with the pituitary gland, the pea-sized master gland of the endocrine system. Light pressure applied to this pressure point will boost memory and concentration and relieve stress. Keep pumpkin seeds in your desk drawer . Just a handful a day provides the recommended daily amount of zinc, vital for enhancing memory and thinking skills. Pumpkin seeds also contain omega-3 oils which are great brain food. These oils help build and maintain the myelin sheath that protects our brain nerve fibres - allowing messages to flow freely. If you don’t like pumpkin seeds walnuts are another great omega-3 brain snack you can keep on your desk. Opt for activated nuts – available from Planet Organic – for optimum nutrient absorption.

Swap cereals for kippers and wholemeal toast and you’ll soon ramp up brain-boosting essential fatty acids (EFAs) and slow release sugars, needed to stay focused all day. Swapping cereal for fish at breakfast can ramp up brain-boosting essential fatty acids . Oily fish deliver a powerful EFA boost in a form that’s easily absorbed by the body, containing both EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids. Low DHA levels have been linked to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease and memory loss. Other good options include salmon, trout, mackerel, herring, sardines or pilchards. And if you’re serving them on toast, opt for wholegrain granary bread, which has a low-GI and releases glucose into the bloodstream more slowly, a steady blood sugar level will also help keep you mentally alert throughout the day. Take a deep breath . Slow your breath down when you need to focus, do a presentation or attend an interview. Deepening your breathing can change brainwave patterns activating theta waves, a brain state associated with enhanced memory. To activate theta waves switch your breathing to your lower abdomen and start breathing from your stomach and consciously slow your breath. 1. Breathe in for the count of six. 2. Hold it (count to two) 3. Let the breathe out slowly (count to nine approx.) After a few moments you should feel calm and more receptive to new information. To improve memory even further combine deep breathing with mindfulness. Look at cute pet pictures . Next time you’re feeling fuzzy-headed, log on to PetSugar for an instant reboot. Yes, you read that right, far from being the ultimate timewaster trawling through cute kitten photos could actually help you meet that deadline at work. It sounds unlikely we know but a study by Japanese researchers found that university students behaved ‘more deliberately and perform tasks with greater time and care,’ after viewing photos of cute kittens and puppies.

Do yoga at lunchtime . Aerobic exercise is good for your heart and health but a lunchtime yoga class will help you stay sharp. After the yoga you are better able to focus and process information quickly, more accurately. In one study, reported in the, researchers gave participants a series of yoga exercises, including isometric contractions of different muscles in the body. The exercises were followed by a meditation session, when participants focused on posture and deep breathing. After the yoga session they were given a series of mental tests. The researchers at the University of Illinois also put the guinea pigs through their paces on a treadmill for the same 20-minute period, keeping their heart rate up between 60 and 70 per cent of the maximum. Aerobic exercise is good for your heart and health but a lunchtime yoga class will help you stay sharp . They found that people who had been for a 20-minute jog were less able to focus mentally on tasks than they were following a yoga session. Also those who had done yoga could learn, hold and update pieces of information more effectively than after performing an aerobic exercise. Breathing and meditative yoga calms the mind and body, reducing distracting thoughts while you focus on your body, posture or breath. The scientists in the study believed that this could have a beneficial, wider-reaching effect on your day, beyond the yoga class, when you try to focus on tasks requiring concentration.

Lauren, 19, uses a wheelchair and sleeps for many hours at Children's Hospital in Cincinnati where she is being treated for a brain tumor. She has expressed her desire to help others there as she continues to fight her disease. During her senior year of high school, Lauren was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent. Scroll down for video . Tracking her progress: Lauren Hill's mother Lisa posts photos of her daughter along with . Made It: Lauren Hill, 19, made it through a full season with the Mount St. Joseph's women's basketball team while raising more than $1.5 million for research into the type of brain tumor that will likely end her life . But she still made it through a full season at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati while raising more than $1.5 million for others with her condition. CBS reports that Hill has a new goal which is to raise a total of $2.2 million for treatment and research. Her mother Lisa updates her followers on the Facebook page for Lauren's Fight For Cure about her daughter's progress and said that Lauren had a wonderful Easter but that she is still struggling. 'Not much has change in Laurens status since she aired on The View. Occasional headache and still very tired but humor remains intact when she can work it in. This week we are getting ready for Easter and have been enjoying some time in the spring sunshine. Some of her teammates decided to get things hopping to make sure she was ready for Sunday. Hope everyone has a wonderful weekend,' Lisa wrote on April 1. Blonde for Easter: Despite Lauren's disease getting worse, she has posted photos of herself on Facebook . Most recently on April 7 Lauren's mother Lisa wrote, 'Today was Brent's Birthday. Lauren greeted him this morning with a huge smile and open arms. Hugs for dad on his birthday. I so wish with all my heart I could give him the gift he really wished for. What we all wish for..... The CURE! My heart is breaking and I wish someone would wake us all up from this nightmare.' Lauren has maintained her resilient spirit throughout this tragic struggle even though doctors have not yet found a cure. Lauren recently appeared on ABC's The View where she spoke about basketball and her condition. Fun times: Lauren is pictured in the hospital on St. Patrick's Day where she seemed to be in good spirits . 'You're supposed to make the best of every moment, but it's hard. It's really, really hard,' Lauren told a WCPO crew that helped set up her interview. Lauren fails to give up in spite of her condition. In September 2014, Hill's doctor told her she would not live past December, FOX reports. But Hill drastically defied expectations. She played four basketball games with her team early in the season, making five layups. As her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach, attending games when possible. She tires easily now and needs to use a wheelchair often. Diagnosed: During her senior year of high school, Hill (left and right) was diagnosed with DIPG (Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma), a rare form of brain cancer with a survival rate of less than 10 percent . The NCAA granted permission to move up the school's opening game because of her worsening condition, and she made a layup for the first basket in a game at Xavier University's 10,000-seat arena. The team had planned to have its annual end-of-the-season banquet on Feb. 22 — a date that matches Hill's uniform number — but the final game got pushed back because of the weather. Hill was getting treated at Cincinnati Children's Hospital. So the team decided to take the banquet to the hospital, using a meeting room. Instead of having a big meal and awards, the players got sandwiches and spent time together. 'We were going to get something to eat, show up, talk about the season and celebrate being with each other,' Benjamin said. The team wore special gray jerseys for the first game at Xavier's arena. The NCAA prohibits schools from giving gifts to players, so they bought them for $22, another way to support Hill's fundraising for cancer research. Hill signed each of the jerseys at the banquet. In a recent interview with WKRC-TV, Hill said, 'Life is precious. ... Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

Austrian designers, Maya Pindeus, 24, and Johanna Pichlbauer, 25, have created a robot that takes the effort out of applying make-up - by doing it for you. The device applies eyeliner with a long black brush, while an attachment smears lipstick on lips, before lighting up when the process  is complete. Scroll down for video . There's clearly still a few precision kinks with the Beautification machine created by Austrian designers Maya Pindeus and Johanna Pichlbauer . A visitor lets the machine apply her red lipstick thanks to a crank which creates a circular rotation . The robot made its debut at the exhibition, Biennale Internationale Design Saint-Etienne 2015, in France, and gallery visitors were in for a treat. The machine is composed of three components: a lipstick wheel, an eyeliner applicator, and a mask which illuminates when the 'beautification' was complete. Women were then filmed testing the machine for the two University of Vienna students' art project entitled Beautification. When creating a device for such a personal ritual as applying make-up, anyone would think that the robots would favour precision and speed, but this was - hilariously- not the case. The beginning of the video shows the designers setting up and creating the machine's frame which includes two magnified mirrors. Each device is fitted with chin rests in order to let the user know where to position their faces. Another girl has felt the wrath of the machine, which has dealt her face many random strokes of eyeliner . A gallery visitor rests her head on the chin rest, expecting eyeliner to be expertly applied . The eyeliner is fixed to a robotic arm, which moves the brush in a movement intended to mimic that of a hand, against the backdrop of a mirror with the motto, 'with determined brush strokes the cosmetic ritual takes its course' inscribed into the glass. The lipstick wand is secured to a crank which  rotates in small circles. Once each area has been completed, a mask threaded with LEDs lights up in the corresponding part of  the female face. The video shows how it's only when visitors begin trying out the make-up robot that they realise precision is not the machine's greatest attribute. Each woman rests their chin on the chin-rest and the eyeliner brush is seen swiping wildly, leaving them with smears of kohl on their foreheads, eyelids and along the bridge of their nose. At one point the robot actually smears the eyeliner directly into a unsuspecting girl's eye. The lipstick robot is slightly more successful than the eyeliner robot, as the user can control how much lipstick is applied . Next a woman  trials the lipstick wand but the speedy circular rotation of the lipstick isn't well aligned to the natural shape of a pair of lips. The user is left with a  circular smudge over her  lips and chin. But Pindeus and Pichlbauer say the robots weren't intended to revolutionise make-up, explaining: 'We wanted to explore the relationship between humans and machines.' The designers found the results of the art project were differed from their initial expectations. 'We expected the outcome to be threatening and a little creepy but instead we discovered a very affectionate side in our robot. One woman is waiting for her eyeliner to be applied, with her face directly aligned with the brush . She gets a shock when the eyeliner brush swipes directly into her eye . 'The interaction with our machine made people smile. Its tireless spins, the way it didn’t quite succeed, it seemed to have its own ideas of what looked good in a human face.' On their Tumblr page, the pair explain the inspiration for the project: 'Without us paying much attention, many processes and rituals in our lives have been taken over by machines which are said to be cold and unemotional.' The designers added: 'Our machines, however, have their own will, their own ideals. We want to put users in the beauty care of robots, to experience what it feels like when delicate decisions that are usually made by themselves are now determined by machines.' The third component of the make-up robots is a light mask (pictured), which is meant to illuminate parts of the face it is satisfied with .","Created by designers Maya Pindeus, 24, and Johanna Pichlbauer, 25 .

Charlotte Li, 26, from London, decided to design Healthy Selfie with her husband Joe after they both achieved incredible results taking photos of their bodies while on a health kick. She said the idea for it came after an over-indulgent Christmas left her feeling ‘fat and unhealthy’. Scroll down for video . Charlotte reveals how taking selfies helped her to stay motivated to get fit and stay in shape . Charlotte said: 'With no holidays on the horizon and hence no impending bikini body exposure to panic about, we needed something else to give us some motivation to get in the gym. 'That motivation came in the form of stripping down to my bra and pants, and taking my first body selfie. 'I was by no means overweight, however, by looking at my body objectively, I wasn’t happy with what I saw and I decided I needed to make a change. 'I started a new fitness programme, and started eating reasonably healthily.’ Joe also charted his own success through a series of selfies before he and Charlotte decided to launch Healthy Selfie. Charlotte continued to take photos each week and would compare them to see how far she had come. She said: 'At the end of a six-week period, I compared the images with the help of Joe’s Photoshop expertise. 'The results were incredible – my body had completely changed – all in complete contradiction to the number on the scales - which had risen as I gained more muscle.' Charlotte and Joe (right) launched  the app after taking selfies  following an an indulgent Christmas . Joe charted his own success through a series of selfies before he and Charlotte decided to launch the app . Charlotte said: 'This was where the idea for Healthy Selfie was born. We wanted to create an app that made tracking and comparing your selfies a quick and easy process. 'By then publishing those photos in a social networking environment, the images become so much more than a self-tracking tool – they become a source of information from which other users can glean ideas and inspiration. 'Your images become testaments to the efficacy of whatever programme, diet, detox or cleanse you’re pursuing.' Charlotte says the app also provides a safe and supportive community for you to upload your pictures too, with users using the comments section to encourage each other on their journeys. Two people who have used the app said it helped them to overcome their own body issues. A student who was told he would never have a six-pack finally achieved his dream.

'The initial reason for starting my transformation was to improve strength as well as fitness for sport. 'However I received harsh “banter” from my peers at school and I recall one friend saying I will never get a six pack. I allowed this to fuel my determination to this day.' Harry says using the app he charted his progress: 'It's given me a great confidence boost, and yes, I definitely feel encouraged to continue posting progress pics. 'If you ever start doubting your progress; looking at old photos make you realise just how much your physique has improved. 'No one expects to become Arnold Schwarzenegger overnight, but the small incremental changes that you don’t notice from just looking in the mirror every day, is what kept me motivated to continue.

A 17-year-old woman – who didn’t want to be named – revealed the app helped her fight anorexia, which started at 14, including helping her to regain weight and muscle. She said: 'I really got into healthy eating because I wanted to lose weight. 'My friend was a synchronised swimmer and she was so toned, I wanted to look just like her. ‘I joined a fitness club at school, got quite strong and pretty toned; I looked good. 'But it became obsessive: my “healthy” eating got so restrictive I was living off salads and fruit. I exercised every day, to the point of collapsing. ‘I ate less and less, thinking that was the key to being healthy, but I was so wrong.

The police and bomb squad were called after the four-propeller, 50-centimeter wide drone, was spotted by member of the Prime Minister's staff, on the roof of his principle office and residence in Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo. The drone was equipped with a small camera and a plastic bottle containing small traces of a radioactive material, according to Japanese media. Radioactive: The drone, which landed on the roof of the Japanese Prime Minister's official residence, was found to contain traces of a radioactive substance . Alert: Police and security officers investigate an unidentified drone found on the rooftop of the Prime Minister's official residence in Tokyo . The radioactive material is likely caesium, a soft metal and harmless to the human body, Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. It is not known who flew the drone onto the building but it is widely suspected it was someone protesting against the country's nuclear policy. People in Japan have become increasingly wary about the number of nuclear power plants in the country, following the disaster at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Flown in: The blue tarpaulin covering the drone can be seen next to the helicopter pad on the roof of the Prime Minister's office in Tokyo . Guarded: Police and the bomb squad were called in after a member of the Prime Minister's staff noticed the drone on the roof . Tests to determine whether to plant should be decommissioned are currently being carried out, though many are skeptical over whether it would happen. Meanwhile, the Japanese government reportedly plans to dump 30 million tonnes of radioactive debris from the disaster in a waste complex by nearby village, Okuma. Anti-nuclear protests were held outside the Kagoshima District Court to stop reactors at Kyushu Electric Power Co's Sendai nuclear-power station in Satsumasendai, southwest Japan from being restarted, amid fears they were at risk fro earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

The courts agreed, meaning they will be back online in less than two years. The drone was initially covered with a piece of cardboard and covered by blue tarpaulin before being removed. Mr Abe was not in residence at the time as he is currently in Indonesia attending the Asia-Africa conference in Jakarta.

Three men have today been arrested on suspicion of murdering missing chef Claudia Lawrence. North Yorkshire police confirmed the men - all aged in their 50s and from the York area - were arrested this morning. The body of the missing chef, who was 35 when she disappeared in 2009, has still not been found. Officers have now launched a fresh search for evidence which could lead to her whereabouts, which is set to continue over a number of days. Police and forensic officers have been working at three houses not far from where Miss Lawrence lived in the Heworth area of York before she went missing six years ago. It is understood the three men have not been arrested before and they remain in custody. A man, in his 50s and from the York area, was arrested last month on suspicion of her murder. He was later released on bail. A 60-year-old man was arrested last year in connection with her disappearance and suspected murder but was later released without charge. Miss Lawrence was last seen on March 18, 2009. She was reported missing by her father after concerns were raised when she failed to turn up for her 6am shift at the University of York. Detectives began reviewing the case in 2013 and have since carried out a number of searches, including a detailed re-examination of Miss Lawrence's home, in the Heworth area of York, and a fingertip search of an alleyway that leads to the rear of the house. They have also issued previously unseen CCTV footage of two people walking near the house. The new arrests, and the arrest in March, are understood to be linked to these lines of inquiry. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, head of North Yorkshire Police's Major Crime Unit and the senior investigating officer in the Claudia Lawrence inquiry, said: 'I urge everyone to again show restraint and patience while we carry out these very important enquiries. Your co-operation and support is greatly appreciated by the investigation team.'

At another property, forensics officers wearing white protective suits were clearly at work. Each of the houses is under police guard. Martin Dales, friend of Claudia's father, said the new arrests were a positive movement in the investigation but that progress was a series of ups and downs for the family. Speaking outside the chef's house, he said: 'Peter finds it very hard, going up and down. 'You feel like you might be getting somewhere and then you get let down. 'Three arrests is certainly a big movement for the police though. 'That's four people in the space of one month.

Superior Court Judge Carl Taylor in Middletown, Connecticut, denied requests made last month by attorneys for both Cassandra and her mother, Jackie Fortin, that the 17-year-old be released from the temporary custody of the state Department of Children and Families, or that her mother be permitted to visit her in the hospital. The judge ruled on Wednesday she must remain in DCF custody until completing court-ordered chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford. Scroll down for video... Going nowhere: Cassandra Fortin was ordered by the Connecticut Supreme Court to undergo cancer treatment . Picture of health: Cassandra has been at Children's Medical Center in Hartford since December receiving chemo to which she was originally opposed . In state care: The Department of Children and Families took temporary custody after Cassandra refused her chemotherapy treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma . The state agency last fall won temporary custody of Cassandra after she and her mother argued she did not want chemo treatments despite the risk of dying without them. The state Supreme Court then ruled against Cassandra's claim that she was mature enough to make her own medical decisions. Treatments were ordered for at least six months after doctors said the teen had an 85 percent chance of survival with chemotherapy, but faced a near certainty of death within two years without it. But after she was declared by doctors to be in remission in March, her lawyer Joshua Michtom and attorneys for her mother appealed at a closed-door court hearing seeking permission to allow her to go home to complete treatments, or at least to permit her mother to visit her in the hospital. Staying put: Ms Fortin, left, said the hospital tried to prevent her mother, Jackie, right, from visiting her room . Support: Mrs Fortin, pictured, said she was behind her daughter's decision to not undergo cancer treatment. Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells . Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body. The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50. The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever). It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy. Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent. Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 'She hasn't been able to see her mother for months, and now that she's in remission we don't think that's in her best interests,' said Attorney James Sexton, representing Fortin. DCF Commissioner Joette Katz said in a statement Wednesday her agency is 'looking forward to the day later this month when Cassandra can happily return home after her treatment is completed and the doctors are confident that she has beaten the cancer.' The case drew national attention when the teen rejected chemotherapy treatments after being diagnosed in September. Both the teen and her mother said she didn't want to poison her body, and she ran away after two chemo treatments. Michael Taylor, an attorney for the teen's mother, Jackie Fortin, said if the judge will not lift the temporary custody order, they would like for the teen at least to be able to visit with her mother at the hospital. Ms Fortinh said DCF has prohibited her from having contact with her mother. 'We'd like to end the whole thing,' Taylor said, according to The Hartford Courant, during a break in the hearing, 'but if we can't, we want to do as much as we can for her. She wants to be with her mother.' After Ms Fortin was diagnosed with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma in September, she and her mother missed several appointments, prompting doctors to notify the DCF, court documents say. A trial court in November granted DCF temporary custody of Ms Fortin. Lawyers for Cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but failed. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which ruled in January that the state wasn't violating Ms Fortin's rights by forcing her to undergo chemotherapy. The case centered on the mature minor doctrine recognised by several other states — whether 16- and 17-year-olds are mature enough to make their own medical decisions. Ms Fortin told People.com that she did not want to undergo chemotherapy and that when she was taken into care the state tried to prevent her mother from paying a visit. She said the hospital even posted a guard outside her door because they feared that she would try to escape. On the day before her chemotherapy, hospital staff were forced to restrain her before they could administer an anaesthetic. A judge has ruled against the 17-year-old girl who originally refused chemotherapy, and she will have to finish her treatments at the hospital instead of going home . She said: 'When a nurse came in and I told myself just to fight. When she started to put an IV in me, I wouldn't let her.' Ms Fortin spent two hours arguing with a doctor trying to convince them to suspend her treatment. 'Security had to pick me up, pin me to the bed and strap me down by my wrists and ankles, When I woke up, I looked down and there was a port in my chest. I thought, 'I cannot believe they did this to me.' 'I felt violated. I felt like I was being treated like an animal. I thought, 'How can you force a person, regardless of how old they are, to do something they haven't given consent to?''' In a statement Connecticut's DCF said:  'When experts -- such as the several physicians involved in this case -- tell us with certainty that a child will die as a result of leaving a decision up to a parent, then the Department has a responsibility to take action. Even if the decision might result in criticism, we have an obligation to protect the life of the child when there is consensus among the medical experts that action is required. 'Much of the improvements in Connecticut's child welfare system have come from working with families voluntarily to realise solutions to family challenges. 'Unfortunately that can't happen in every situation, especially when the life of a child is at stake.'

The crash happened on Easter Sunday night on Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest, northern Sydney at a traffic light intersection.

But Benedict Cumberbatch found the shoe was very much on the other foot when he tried his hand at table tennis yesterday. The Sherlock star was challenged to a game by Chinese ping pong legend Deng Yaping while hosting the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai, it was reported by People's Daily Online. But despite using a wooden spoon to give the actor a fighting chance, Deng still won the match. Here's how it's done, detective: Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch is challenged to a table tennis match by Chinese ping pong legend Deng Yaping, who beat him despite playing with a wooden spoon . Cumberbatch is a huge celebrity in China because of the popularity of the Sherlock TV series and his skit with Deng went down a storm with the audience. Opening the sketch, the star says: 'I'm getting a little nervous because I can't help noticing that there's a ping pong table behind us.' Turning to Deng, he says: 'You want me to play you?' She replies: 'How about that?' to which Cumberbatch gasps: 'Oh my God!' Deng, one of the world's most successful players, at first offers the star a jumbo-sized paddle in an attempt to ease his nerves. But politely declining, he says: 'I'm a bit better than that.' The Sherlock Star was challenged to a game while hosting the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Level playing field: Deng, one of the world's most successful players, eventually plays with a normal paddle . She then hands him a normal-sized paddle, but Cumberbatch still fears he will be beaten. As a final option, she picks up a wooden spoon, adding: 'My mum uses this for cooking.' The actor jokes: 'And you're going to beat me with it? That's what my mother used to say to me!' The pair have three rallies which end with Cumberbatch hitting it into the net twice and shooting it long the third time.

8630,21030573ff6bfdee513380f10df25af64cf66a17,"Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless. The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, José Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than £300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for.

There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight. Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout. 'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'","Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather meet in Las Vegas on May 2 in 'The Fight of the Century'

1285,812c458d659ff3a69110ded55708d8437076e381,"A busy mum sits at a table surrounded by crayons, colouring in a child's book, taking care to stay within the printed lines and fully concentrating on the task. There's nothing unusual about that, you might think, except there's not a child in sight...and the mum is simply colouring in because she wants to. Grown ups reaching for the crayons is a new global trend it seems, as adults say they're attracted to the creativity that colouring in affords. Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford has sold more than 1.4million copies of her colouring-in book for grown-ups, Secret Garden. The follow-up, Enchanted Forest, is expected to do just as well . Art and flowers: The book is the most popular in its genre and has now been translated into 22 languages . If you needed any proof, then browsing Amazon's bestseller list offers it. A book called Secret Garden by Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford, which includes 96 pages of black-and-white drawings has sold more than 1.4million copies and is riding high in the bestsellers chart. So far, it's been translated into 22 different languages. The New York Times has even reported on 'colouring-in groups', where grown-ups meet, as if they were in a knitting circle or book club, just to neatly daub colour on the right side of lines together. The arty fad is said to have started in France, where it was promoted as both a therapeutic hobby and a way of rediscovering lost creativity. Adult colouring-in titles are now said to be outselling cook books in the country, no mean feat for a destination that holds gastronomy so close to its heart. The allure is said to be the unadulterated pleasure of doing something for no purpose other than to enjoy the practice of colouring and staying within the lines. According to experts, it's a kickback against the stresses of modern life and technology, where everything, even leisure time has to be in some way useful or aspirational. The images in Basford's book are not particularly adult in theme, they depict scenes of both nature and fantasy. Basford, 31, told The Times: 'Colouring in appeals to people because it’s a chance to do an analogue activity that’s not on a screen. Everyone is creative deep down but as you get older you get less confident in your abilities.' The artist's second book, Enchanted Forest, is showing all signs of eclipsing the success of her first work. Basford says her success is down to people resisting modern technology in their leisure time. She says: 'Colouring in appeals to people because it’s a chance to do an analogue activity that’s not on a screen' In Australia, colouring-in circles have emerged, such is the pursuit's current popularity. One crayon fantatic Jenny Keane told the Sydney Morning Herald that she even enjoys colouring in with her husband: 'During the week some people like to go to the bar to decompress, whereas my husband and I like to sit down together and just colour.' She adds: 'I can't draw but I like to use my hands to get creative. Some people might use yoga or running but colouring for me is my sense of peace.' A study in the US in 2012 found that colouring in reduced anxiety among university students.","Johanna Basford has sold 1.4million copies of her book Secret Garden .

4429,bf812636eb42024beedf6e2ad40e376cb9f86d98,"A mother was removed from a train and taken away in a police van because she took home a clothes horse she had found 'abandoned' in a carriage. Aimee Craven, of Hull, East Yorkshire, had claimed the Tesco product worth £20 and taken it home after spotting it on a train the previous week - because she thought it had been left by its owner. But British Transport Police officers trawled through CCTV footage to track down the 32-year-old care worker before taking her off a train as she travelled to work in Brough. Police investigation: Mother-of-one Aimee Craven, of Hull, East Yorkshire, was accused of trying to shield the £20 Tesco clothes horse from CCTV as she walked off the train in Brough (above) with it . Miss Craven - who is now waiting to see if she will be charged, but has been told it is likely she will receive a caution for theft - said: ‘I was the first person to get on the train and I spotted it. ‘I know the right thing to do would have been to hand it in but I thought, “I’ll have it”. It was a spur of the moment, stupid decision, which I am sorry for. ‘But I don’t think what I did justifies everything that then happened. The police got on the train, asked me to step off it and I had no idea what it was about. ‘Everyone was looking at me. I was absolutely traumatised, it was awful. They asked me if I’d taken it and I told them the truth. They said it was theft.’ Police insisted to MailOnline that she was not arrested - and told how the victim was on the train at the time of the theft, and had placed the clothes horse behind her seat while travelling. After being taken off the train, Miss Craven was driven home in a police van and asked how long she had lived at her address and whether she owned the property. Facing a caution for theft: Miss Craven was asked by British Transport Police to go for questioning at their offices at Hull Paragon (above), where she was given a solicitor, paid for by legal aid . She was also said to have been asked where she worked, how long she had worked there, which shifts she did and what time she finished. Miss Craven was then made to take her wet clothes off the airer she had been using for a week, while police waited to confiscate the item. The mother-of-one, who cares for the elderly, was then allegedly asked to attend a police station for questioning where she had her DNA taken from a mouth swab and was fingerprinted. She said: ‘When I got home and went in and said the police are here for the clothes horse my boyfriend thought I was joking. ‘He said, “Oh very funny, April Fools’ was ages ago”. Then when I started taking the clothes off he said, “Aimee I think you are going too far now”. He just didn’t believe me until he saw me giving it to the police.’ The officers then asked Miss Craven to go back for questioning at their offices at Hull Paragon, where she was given a solicitor, paid for by legal aid. She was accused of trying to shield the item from CCTV as she walked off the train in Brough. Miss Craven, who has no convictions, said: ‘They made me feel like I was Hull’s most wanted. It really has been the worst experience of my life. With all the questions and them prying into my life I was petrified. ‘My solicitor said even if you found something in a skip and took it you could be done for theft and so he advised me to admit theft to get a caution, otherwise it would go to court. ‘The whole thing is ridiculous, it’s cost a lot more than the price of the clothes horse. I’d have happily bought her a new one. It’s a complete waste of their time and taxpayers’ money. ‘I’ve had to admit theft to get a caution, which I don’t agree with and I’ve now got a criminal record.’ A British Transport Police spokesman told MailOnline: ‘Following the alleged theft of a clothes horse from the 7.10am Hull to King's Cross service on April 9, a 32-year-old woman from Hull was interviewed after she voluntary attended Hull police station. 'The rightful owner of the clothes horse had placed it behind her seat and discovered it was missing when the train arrived at Brough station approximately 15 minutes later. She contacted police after seeing a woman walking along the platform carrying it. 'The woman was identified after officers reviewed CCTV from the station and undertook an anniversary visit. The item was recovered and has been returned to its owner. She has thanked officers for their actions. 'British Transport Police treats all reports of theft reported to us seriously, regardless of the item stolen, and will investigate every offence thoroughly.'","Aimee Craven, 32, took home Tesco product after spotting it on train .

ABC News reports that Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for their work. 'All shots were done perfectly. These executions were carried out smoothly and in order - much better than the first round of executions in January,' he said. Scroll down for video . Indonesian attorney-general H.M. Prasetyo (right) applauded Chan and Sukumaran's executioners for the good job that they did . Mr Prasetyo (second right) said that 'all the shots were done perfectly' at the execution . The Indonesian attorney-general believed that Wednesday morning's execution was much better than one carried out in January . Mr Prasetyo declared it was necessary to fight drug crime in the country, as he dismissed Australia's withdrawal of its ambassador as a 'momentary reaction'. He visited Nusakambangan on Wednesday, hours after Bali Nine pair were executed with other drug offenders. 'I would like to say that an execution is not a pleasant thing. It is not a fun job,' he said. 'But we must do it in order to save the nation from the danger of drugs. We are not making enemies of counties from where those executed came. What we are fighting against is drug-related crimes. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australia will withdraw its ambassador to Indonesia in an unprecedented diplomatic response to the executions of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . Indonesian president Joko Widodo failed to return Australian PM Tony Abbott's phone calls about the Bali Nine in March . 'Therefore, I would like to offer my condolences, on the execution of those who were on the death row, to their families, to their home countries. 'Once again, we are not against the countries, but we are fighting a war against the horrible drug crimes that threaten our nation's survival.' Mr Prasetyo shrugged off diplomatic backlash from Australia after Prime Minister Tony Abbott slammed the executions  as 'cruel and unnecessary' and announced he would withdraw Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson. 'The Netherlands have done the same thing in the past. Brazil has done the same thing,' he said. 'I think this is just a momentary reaction, and this will be settled within the diplomatic sphere.' Indonesia's Vice President Jusuf Kalla said withdrawing an ambassador was a normal diplomatic protest. 'Within a month or two, they will come back. That's the signal of protest, we did that too,' he said, referring to the time Indonesia withdrew its ambassador to Australia in 2013 over a phone tapping scandal. Prasetyo said the executions would serve as a warning to others. 'This is a warning for others, don't even try to commit these drug crimes, to think a thousand times, that Indonesia will be strict, will be harsh on drug crimes,' he told reporters in Cilacap. 'The result of the second execution was better, more orderly and more perfect than the last,' he said, referring to executions carried out in January and noting the bodies were treated more 'humanely' this time. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo raised his nation's sovereignty when asked about Australia withdrawing its ambassador. 'Our sovereignty must be respected,' he told reporters. Rest in peace: Myuran Sukumaran (foreground) and Andrew Chan (back) were executed . 'We're ready to respect the sovereignty of other countries as well.' Mr Abbott announced Australia's unprecedented diplomatic response on Wednesday morning, just hours after the Bali Nine duo were put to death despite pleas for their deaths to be reconsidered. 'Australia respects the Indonesian system, we respect Indonesia's sovereignty but we do deplore what's been done and this cannot simply be business as usual,' Mr Abbott said. 'For that reason once all the courtesies have been extended to the Chan and Sukumaran families our ambassador will be withdrawn for consultations.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect'. 'And I expect to be able to discuss further aspects of our relationship with Indonesia when our ambassador Paul Grigson returns to Australia at the end of this week,' Ms Bishop said. The consul general Majel Hind will formally identify the bodies. Ms Bishop hasn't ruled out cutting Australian aid to Indonesia in protest over the executions of Chan and Sukumaran. Australia's ambassador to Indonesia Paul Grigson will return to Australia at the end of this week . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (left) said Australian consular officials in Indonesia will arrange for the men's bodies to be repatriated to Australia, ensuring that they are treated with 'appropriate dignity and respect' Australia gives Indonesia about $600 million in aid annually, and is its second largest international benefactor behind Japan. Asked if Australia would respond to the executions by reducing the aid budget, Ms Bishop said it was under different consideration to diplomatic actions such as recalling the ambassador. 'Any announcement to the aid budget will be made at budget time in early May,' she told reporters in Canberra. Mr Abbott stressed that Australia has a 'very important' relationship with Indonesia. 'But it has suffered as a result of what's been done over the last few hours,' he said. 'Whatever people think of the death penalty, whatever people think of drug crime, the fact is that these two families have suffered an appalling tragedy and I'm sure that every Australian's thoughts and prayers will be with those families at this time.' The Prime Minister said he understood people's anger at the executions, but said the government did not want to make a difficult situation worse. 'So I would say to people yes, you are absolutely entitled to be angry but we've got to be very careful to ensure that we do not allow our anger to make a bad situation worse,' he said. 'The relationship between Australia and Indonesia is important, remains important, will always be important, will become more important as time goes by. 'While this is a dark moment in the relationship I am confident that the relationship will be restored for the great benefit of both our countries.' Opposition Leader Bill Shorten acknowledged Australians had the right to be outraged but rejected talk of boycotts. 'I don't and we shouldn't hold ordinary or individual Indonesian people responsible,"" he said. 'What Australians need to do is campaign against the death penalty wherever it exists.' Backlash begins: At 6am AEST, hundreds of Twitter users were already pledging to 'boycott Indonesia' Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Should Australia respect Indonesia's decision to execute Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan? Now share your opinion . The executions by firing squad occurred at 3:25am AEST on Wednesday evening and came despite months of pressure from the Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop. Senior officials were already angered by a series of snubs from the Indonesians. President Widodo repeatedly refused to return Mr Abbott's phone calls on the issue. Ms Bishop was also angered by the Indonesians' decision to announce the executions were going ahead on Anzac Day, one of Australia's most solemn days of remembrance. The Bali Nine duo's families released a short statement on Wednesday morning. 'Today we lost Myuran and Andrew. Our sons, our brothers. In the 10 years since they were arrested, they did all they could to make amends, helping many others,' it read. 'They asked for mercy, but there was none. They were immensely grateful for all the support they received. We too, will be forever grateful.' Following the executions, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said: 'Indonesia has not just robbed two young men of their lives but robbed itself of two examples of the strengths of its justice system.' Other Labor MPs condemned the killings, with Opposition frontbencher Tony Burke saying 'Lives lost. Nothing gained' and Federal Labor MP Anthony Albanese saying 'RIP Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran - a tragic loss of human life on a very sad day.' Greens Leader Christine Milne said: 'The lives of these two Australians have been ended by firing squad at the direction of the Indonesian government. We in Australia must continue to advocate for an end to capital punishment.' Stern words: Julie Bishop has pleaded for the Indonesian government not to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran for months . Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, is widely regarded as weak. He has ignored international pressure to cease executions of foreign drug convicts . Immediately following the executions, parliamentary secretary Steven Ciobo tweeted: 'There are few greater displays of abuse of power and regressive thinking than the death penalty #RIP', tweeted. He was joined by western Sydney backbencher Fiona Scott, who said: 'The death penalty is barbaric and inhumane torture. Murder is murder.' Brazil already recalled its ambassador in January when one of its citizens was executed by Indonesia. But Indonesia forged ahead with more executions overnight, killing six others - including a Frenchman - and shrugging off pressure from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. There is also the potential for other ramifications from Australia. Top human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson has suggested Australia could withdraw its $600 million of aid to Indonesia per year and redirect it to Nepal. 'Nepal needs it more,' said Mr Robertson, who accused Indonesia of breaching international law in three instances. Ms Bishop and her Labor counterpart, Tanya Plibersek (right), have been a united force in their opposition to the executions . In an interview with ABC's 730 program on Tuesday evening, Ms Bishop refused to detail the consequences for the Indonesian government. 'I don't intend to focus on the consequences,' she said. 'But of course, should these executions proceed in the manner that I anticipate, of course there will be have to be consequences. I don't want to go into the details.' After months of pleading with the Indonesians - even offering a prisoner swap, paid by Australia - officials still worked on Mr Widodo until the last moment. Late on Tuesday evening, the Australian embassy in Jakarta circulated an extraordinary joint statement with the European Union and French government addressed to Mr Widodo. The statement said: 'It is not too late to change your mind.' But with the exception of Filipino convict Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso - who was spared - Mr Widodo did not.","H.M.

Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once the singer's staunchest defender, now claims Jackson was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff has scheduled a hearing for Robson and another of Jackson's alleged child victims, James Safechuck, on Tuesday that could decide if their respective claims proceed. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once Michael Jackson's staunchest defender, now claims the singer was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child . Robson and Safechuck missed a statutory deadline when they filed their claims more than a year after Jackson's 2009 death. If Judge Beckloff gives Robson, 32, and Safechuck, 36, a green light to proceed with their civil claim, new child molestation allegations will likely be revealed in court against Jackson. Lawyers say the King Of Pop shelled out nearly $200 million to as many as 20 victims, reports the New York Post. The Jordan Chandler lawsuit alone is alleged to have cost more than $40 million. Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride. Safechuck alleges the singer gave him a marriage certificate and a wedding band as keepsakes and confirmation of their 'undying love'. He also alleges that Jackson wrote a check for more than $1 million to Safechuck's father, a sanitation worker. James Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride . 'Jackson was successful in his efforts to the point that my client endured repeated acts of sexual abuse of a heinous nature and was brainwashed... into believing they were acts of love and ­instigated by James himself,' Safechuck's attorneys said in the ­filings. The singer regularly dressed Safe­chuck in clothes identical to his and would tell reporters Safechuck was his cousin, a former employee said. Safechuck's attorney alleges that Jackson molested Safechuck more than 100 times. Robson was a five-year-old dance prodigy in Brisbane, Australia, when he first met the singer. Prior to filing his civil lawsuit in 2013 he had been one of the pop star's biggest supporters, including testifying under oath at Jackson's 2005 molestation trial in California he was never abused by Jackson. Robson was a key reason for Jackson's acquittal. He now says he 'lived in silence and denial for 22 years' and alleges he was seven years old when Jackson first molested him. Former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, left, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw them semi-nude in bed together . Robson accuses Jackson of first molesting him at the Neverland Ranch, while his sister slept in a separate bed just metres away. A former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw Jackson and Robson semi-nude in bed together, the Post reports. The estate has previously asked the court to reject the claims on the basis that Robson waited too long to file and because Jackson is the only other person with knowledge about the accusations and has been dead for more than five years. Robson, a choreographer for Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, says he has been unable to work because of the pain caused by Jackson's abuse. Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest.","Wade Robson and James Safechuck hope to find out on Tuesday if they can bring a civil lawsuit against the late singer's estate .

So Pippa Middleton’s decision to enjoy a plate of whale meat on holiday may have been rather difficult for Prince William to swallow. The 31-year-old, who styles herself as a food and lifestyle writer, has told of eating Minke whale – even though it is largely banned worldwide. She boasted of tucking into the delicacy in Norway, to the horror of environmental campaigners who say she is helping promote an ‘unimaginably cruel’ trade. Scroll down for video . Pippa Middleton has been slammed for ‘promoting the cruel and unnecessary whaling industry’. She's pictured here at the 2014 GQ Men Of The Year awards in London . In a gushing newspaper feature, the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister described how the smoked meat was served in a ‘wonderfully convivial atmosphere’ at the Juvet Landscape Hotel in north-west Norway. Tucking into a starter prepared carpaccio-style – raw and very thinly sliced – she wrote: ‘We dined on smoked whale carpaccio (which tastes similar to smoked salmon but looks more like venison carpaccio).’ Ms Middleton said that she ate whale carpaccio in a 'convivial atmosphere on a large communal table' Earlier she had enjoyed a steam bath and rubbed ice on her body in a ‘snow spa’ at the upmarket hotel, where she spent the night in a £170-a-night ‘designer pod’. The hunting and importation of whale meat is banned in Britain, as it is in most parts of the world, by both the International Whaling Commission and by the international wildlife convention CITES. But Norway – as well as Japan and Iceland – has exploited legal loopholes that allow it to opt out of regulations. Last year it killed around 730 Minke whales, the highest number since it broke the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1993. Campaigners have long called for a crackdown, arguing the hunting process is ‘unimaginably cruel and inhumane’. The socialite, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said that she ate whale at the £123-a-night Juvet Landscape Hotel (pictured) Ms Middleton said that the dinner was cooked by Knut, the hotel’s owner. The Duchess of Cambridge's sister said that the establishment was an 'architectural gem' Pippa Middleton would be breaking British law if she had tucked into the whale meat in the UK. Britain has signed up to the International Whaling Commission, which makes it illegal to import or eat whale meat in this country. Whaling is also prohibited under EU law, but Norway is not a member of the EU. Last season, 731 minke whales were killed in Norway off the country’s northern coasts. The whaling season runs from April to August, when they are hunted from boats using grenade-propelled harpoons, which are shot from cannons into the whale’s chest. In the 1960s and 70s whale meat was commonly served in Norwegian school canteens and as part of military rations. It then fell out of favour, but has recently been adopted as a gourmet food trend. Fish market manager Marius Tvethaug said: ‘Smoked whale is one of the oldest ways to keep food for a long time. And we’ve been catching whale since the Stone Age. I would say it’s kind of back to our roots.’ Even with modern harpoons powered by explosives, the mammals often died a ‘slow and painful’ death. Critics said Miss Middleton’s decision to eat whale meat was at odds with the stance taken by Prince William – even though he too has been attacked for continuing to hunt wild game. She has also been photographed hunting in the past. Vanessa Williams-Grey, of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: ‘It might have been better for Pippa to take a whale watch trip in Norway. She might then have thought twice about condoning and indeed, promoting, this cruel and unnecessary trade.’ Philip Mansbridge, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said she was ‘unwittingly setting a bad example’ that may encourage other tourists. A spokesman for Miss Middleton, who travelled on the junket for the Daily Telegraph, refused to comment last night. But Knut Slinning, owner of Juvet Landscape Hotel, said he had no plans to stop serving whale meat because it has been eaten for ‘many hundreds of years’. However, Siri Martinsen, of Norway’s animals rights group NOAH, said Miss Middleton has a ‘special responsibility’ not to support animal cruelty. Last year 731 minke whales suffered an agonising death at the hand of Norwegian whalers, according to WDC. Pictured is a minke whale on the deck of a Japanese vessel . Three Greenpeace inflatables  interrupt whaling on board the Norwegian whaling vessel Kato in the Southern whaling grounds in the North Sea .

2377,398d3659c24ce1cb878a273bf82b8c6277e74170,"According to a woman who is apparently against the preachings of Andrew Caldwell, the St. Louis man got his just desserts. The 21-year-old became somewhat infamous late last year for video of him screaming 'I don't like mens no more - I like women, women, women!' after a pastor at an evangelical megachurch claimed to have cured his homosexuality. Caldwell hit headlines in November after the footage surfaced of him being 'delivered' by God. But he says he was attacked by an employee at a FroYo in Delmar on Wednesday after the cashier recognized him. He ended up completely doused in his own dessert at the counter. 'I filled (the bowl) all the way up to the top - I had some Kit Kats, I had some Reese's on it,' Caldwell told STL Today. 'It was all all in my face, on my clothes, in my shoes.' Scroll down for video . Unhappy viewer: This is the moment St. Louis FroYo cashier Stephanie Diaz (green shirt) throws a bowl of yogurt in the face of Andrew Caldwell, a man who found internet fame for saying God cured his homosexuality . Doused in dessert: Caldwell claimed Diaz attacked him because she disagreed with his ideals about being 'cured'. However Diaz said he demanded a discount and called her a 'dog' Heated confrontation over frozen yogurt: Caldwell was covered in FroYo, and said his bowl was extra large . Megachurch star: Andrew Caldwell in a still from a video of him speaking during a Church of God in Christ Convention in St. Louis last year, where he infamously said he 'don't like mens no more' Caldwell claims the employee recognized him from his video at the Church of God in Christ's 107th Holy Convocation. He said the woman called him a gay slur, said that it was impossible for God to 'turn' gay people straight, and then picked up the extra large bowl from the scale at the counter and aggressively threw it in Caldwell's face, according to The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. However the employee, Stephanie Diaz, says Caldwell is a liar. In an interview with the same TV station, Diaz said Caldwell demanded a discount for his yogurt. When she didn't relent, he called her a 'dog' and a 'b----', Diaz said. Diaz, who is openly gay, said it had nothing to do with the viral video. 'I threw the ice cream at him,' she said outside of the store Thursday. 'He called me a dog. … I lost it.' 'I lost it': Stephanie Diaz, who is openly gay, admits to throwing the yogurt at Caldwell, but said he is lying about his story . Scene: The incident occurred Wednesday at his FroYo store in Delmar, St.Louis . Comfortably straight: Andrew Caldwell, seen here in a recent photo from his Facebook page, happily announced last year that God had cured his homosexuality and that he had been 'delivered' CCTV footage released of the incident shows Caldwell throwing money at Diaz. That is when Diaz throws the yogurt. The FroYo store released the footage to show Caldwell was lying. Diaz said she had never seen the church video or heard of Caldwell. She has been charged with third-degree assault. However Diaz has not been fired. FroYo have said any punishment that should occur from the incident will be handled internally. Stylish: Caldwell is pictured here dressed in head-to-toe designer clothing on his Facebook page . Caldwell says he is considering suing Diaz and FroYo. In he video of Caldwell being 'delivered' that went viral, he announces into the microphone: 'I’m not gay no more! I am delivered! I don’t like mens no more! I said I like women! Women, women, women! I said women! I’m not gay! I will not date a man! I will not carry a purse! I will not put on makeup! I will love a woman.' The megachurch audience can be heard screaming and cheering in the background, congratulating Caldwell on no longer being gay. The pastor then hands him $100, saying the Lord told him to. After the video spread, Caldwell - who was extravagantly dressed in a paisley suit, purple shirt and mustard bow tie - did a series of interviews, where he said he meant what he said, but was unhappy the video became so popular. He said he did not want to get in front of the church to begin with, but believes his homosexuality no longer exists .","Andrew Caldwell, 21, went viral in November after footage from a St. Louis megachurch showed him screaming 'I don't like mens no more'

10251,9c6518f0aa462c3afe1bc059499cd6d4948f4f9b,"A runaway cab driver ended up sending a pedestrian tumbling through the air before crashing into a bus stop full of waiting passengers. The chilling footage was posted on Facebook and shows the cab throwing 25-year-old Kadeem Brown across a median in the Bronx, New York. The conditions were so icy at the time he slid into the opposite curb before coming to a stop. His green taxi struck and killed  little Tierre Clark who was five. She was waiting with her mother at a bus stop when she was hit by the cab. WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES . Fatal blow: A store owner posted video that shows the moment a cab hits a pedestrian in the Bronx, killing him. The victim is seen in the red circle . Careening: Kadeem Brown, 25, can be seen sliding across the ice after being knocked over by a passing taxi . Shocking:  Brown can be seen laying on the ground as horrified onlookers attempt to summon help . 'Accident happened at 170 and Grand Concourse in front of my bodega,' Facebook user Junior Papi Sanchez posted online. Police say Emilo Garcia, the 44-year-old driver, suffered a seizure moments before the crash on Friday evening. Despite the impact, he reportedly continued driving another 100 feet or so, before jumping a curb and crashing into the group waiting at the bus stop. He finally smashed into the side of a building. Mr Brown died at the scene, while the little girl who is not featured in the video died a short time later. Garcia has since had his TLC license taken away but has not been not been charged with any crime. Gone too soon: Kadeem Brown, 25, was killed . 'A state and city licensed driver has killed two people in broad daylight,' said Charles Komanoff of the safe street group Right of Way. 'The public has every right to demand that everything about the crash and the driver be dug up and made public.' A memorial service was held for Brown Wednesday evening at Mount Carmel Pentecostal Church, and he will be buried Thursday morning. Grieving relatives and friends of Brown posted memories of him on a fundraising page for his family. 'I always admired him, and said that's how our young men should act and carry themselves,' wrote his friend's aunt Tia Linder. 'He was destined for greatness, but God had a much higher calling for him. You can tell a person's true character by what others say about them when they are no longer here.' Another pal wrote that he was always the first friend to wish her a happy birthday. In heaven: Tierre Clarke, 5, was tragically killed on Friday, March 20th when a taxi jumped the curb while waiting for the bus with her mother . 'He was down to earth, and always gave an ear when needed,' wrote Renesha Barrett. 'I miss him already.' Little Tierre Clark died at Lincoln Hospital. 'She loved to sing and dance — that was Tierre,' said the girl's devastated grandmother, Liz Romani, 58 told the Daily News. She would just be walking down the street and break into song. She loved whatever popular music was out.' 'We'd be watching TV, some sitcom, and she would just break into song and start dancing,' Romani said through tears. The family are attempting to raise funds for a funeral for their daughter by also using a crowdfunding page.

11182,113e651a0a484955a0596662185587e648e5ee55,"The flag-burning father of a runaway British jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13. Abase Hussen – who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year – conceded the teenager was ‘maybe’ influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of ‘nothing’ to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video . Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 . Abase Hussen, circled,  marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 . It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies – with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. ‘The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,’ he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: ‘We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.’ Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: ‘Not at all. Nothing.’ Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, tweeted: ‘Remember that Amira Abase’s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.’ Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: ‘I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.’ Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria . Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: ‘The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.’ Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came ‘for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English’. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was ‘just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists’. Mr Hussen said he felt ‘terrible’ to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby’s killers and said: ‘It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don’t do things like this.’ Amira fled to become a ‘jihadi bride’ with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs’ committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: ‘I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. ‘It’s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally. But then to tell a House of Commons committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to Syria, when you have taken her to more than one of these events, is simply breathtaking.’","Abase Hussen said maybe his daughter was influenced by attending a rally .

2909,2b4b5b4c3d7a6459110d806683749f2babbd038f,"A father and his two sons who accosted pensioners with dementia in the street asking for payment for roof repairs they hadn't done have been jailed for a total of eight years. Albert Webb, 51, and sons Jimmy Chuter, 26, and Jesse Webb, 19, followed people aged up to 97 home from the Post Office after they had collected their pensions before demanding the cash. If the victim had no money on them, they would be driven to a nearby cash point to withdraw it, or the trio would con their way into their homes before stealing from them. Albert Webb, 51, from Surrey, was jailed for three and a half years and son Jimmy Chuter, 26, was jailed for four years after they harassed pensioners with dementia in the street, demanding money . In total the family gang carried out 35 thefts, starting in February 2012 - when pensioners were still able to withdraw cash from their local Post Office. Most of the victims were women aged in their 70s or 80s, while the eldest was a 97-year-old man. The trio would drive alongside their victims in a silver Mercedes C200 until they got close to their house, before jumping out and telling them they had come to collect payment for roofing work. Jesse Webb, 19, was due to be sentenced with his father and brother, but went on the run. He was given a 12 month term this week after being caught . In fact, no work had been carried out, but because many of the elderly victims were suffering from dementia, they simply accepted what they were being told. The offending continued until October 2015 across Hertfordshire, Avon and Somerset, Hampshire, Oxford and Surrey. By the time officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary managed to catch up with the gang, it is believed they had taken around £15,000 from their vulnerable victims. Appearing at St Albans Crown Court in January, Chuter, from  Somerset, was jailed for four years for conspiracy to defraud and Albert Webb, from Surrey, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years for burglary and fraud offences. Jesse Webb was due to be sentenced on the same day, but went on the run. He was tracked down and appeared in the dock on Thursday this week, where he was given 12 months behind bars. Detective constable Kieran Doyle said: 'We were able to arrest his father and brother and bring them before the courts but Jesse evaded police so upon their sentencing, we issued a wanted appeal to trace Jesse. 'We received information which led us to him and I'm pleased that he has had his day in court. 'These really were shameful crimes and it's beyond belief that they could stoop so low to pick out their victims and follow them home, and then make them believe they had carried out repairs to their house and harass them for money.' Officers have started proceedings to confiscate their criminal gains under the Proceeds of Crime Act.The vehicle used during the crimes has already been confiscated by police. St Albans Crown Court heard that the trio would follow their elderly victims, often stalking them home from the Post Office, before jumping out of a car and demanding cash for repairs they hadn't done .","Albert Webb, 51, ran con with sons Jimmy Chuter, 26, and Jesse Webb, 19 .

2899,6afcbbdb7c699053abc14b140f66f7e8bfc8676a,"In this constantly connected digital world, the chirping of a mobile phone beside the bed is rarely a pleasant way to be woken in the morning. But the team behind a new app clearly feel that the tiny rendition of a rumba blaring from your mobile is not enough to drag you from beneath the covers. Instead they have developed an alarm that will only turn off if you physically get out of bed and scan a bar code in another part of your house. Scroll down for video . The I'm UP Alarm can be set to go off the night before (left) and will then only turn off by scanning a QR code (pictured right) on a mug or magnet that can be kept in another room, forcing you to get out of bed to do so . Michael Smagon, the New York-based inventor of the I'm Up Alarm, said: 'We all hit the snooze, toss and turn, and fall back asleep. Then we do the morning dash because we lose those coveted morning minutes. 'I’m Up is a mobile app alarm clock that is linked to a QR code that may be anywhere in your home, not in arms reach form bed, and the alarm does not go off until your scan the code, hence getting out of bed.' Smartphone users will be able to download the app onto their phone from June. Each device is paired with a specific QR code that can be printed out and stuck somewhere else in the house. The app developers also say they will be able to print the code onto mugs or magnetic buttons so they can be left in the kitchen to scan while you make your morning coffee. The alarm is set to go off at a certain time the night before and will make a noise until the QR code is scanned. The app uses a Quick Response code, or QR code, which is a form of barcode that the cameras of mobile phones are able to detect. Under Mr Smagon's concept, a code matched specifically to your app can be printed on your favourite mug or a fridge magnet. When the alarm goes off at the designated time, the only way to then get it to stop making a noise is to get out of bed and scan the code. For those who really need an extra couple of minutes, Mr Smagon says the app does have a snooze function, but only for a set number of occasions. He is currently seeking funding on the crowd-funding site Kickstarter to help him test the device. The app is due to be released in June June and and will come as a free version with adverts or an ad-free version which will cost less than $8, or £5.48. The alarm app will have a snooze function but it will only allow users to delay getting up a set number of times . Mugs and magnetic business cards and buttons with the codes printed on them can also be purchased and shipped worldwide or a free code can be printed from the company's website. I'm Up will be available on Apple and Android phones and a version for Windows phones is being developed. Mr Smagon said: 'In the evening you set your alarm for 6am and you have the best intention to wake up at this time, but in the morning everything looks different. 'Every excuse you come up with just to stay those five extra minutes in bed wins. We all know that those five minute snoozes quickly add up and all of a sudden we are late again. 'I'm Up alarm was invented to help people who are not one of those early birds to start the day.' The QR code can be printed onto coffee cups so users can turn off the alarm while making their morning drink .","I'm Up Alarm is designed to help those who have trouble getting out of bed .

But the move has been slammed by the man’s supporters, who have called for a nationwide general strike. His execution took place after he refused to seek presidential clemency. The country’s Supreme Court rejected his final legal appeal against the death sentence, which he received in May 2013. Members of Qamaruzzaman's family visited him yesterday afternoon for the last time, his lawyer Shishir Manir said.

11124,21f81b0be812850a7c25f803d693d2ad051c9f53,"Martin Tyler has been in the commentary game for 40 years, so it's safe to say he's witnessed his fair share of blockbusters. Confessing himself as a 'chief witness' of football it's no surprise, then, that when asked to pick a favourite he is able to pluck one game in particular from his encyclopaedic memory. 'I've been very lucky to cover so many great games but I do usually plump for this same one,' Tyler reminisced with Sky Sports. 'Liverpool 4, Newcastle 3.' Stan Collymore (third left) smashes home Liverpool's fourth past Newcastle goalkeeper Pavel Srnicek . He is of course referring to the seven goal thriller at Anfield on April , 1996, which saw the two Premier League hopefuls slug it out in order to close the gap between themselves and leaders Manchester United. 'Everybody remembers Newcastle going for [the league title] but Liverpool were in the mix as well; and maybe they looked too much at each other because neither of them won it in the end.' Despite Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United finishing top of the pile at the end of the season, the game still firmly holds a place in Tyler's personal archive. Robbie Fowler (second right) rises above John Beresford to head home the opener for Liverpool . Fowler's early goal began the seven goal spectacle that Martin Tyler classed as his favourite game .

'I think if you take all the elements of why we all love football they all happened in this particular game.' With Liverpool's potent striker Robbie Fowler breaking the deadlock on the bobbly Anfield pitch after just two minutes, the outlook looked bleak for Newcastle that evening. However, when Magpies striker Les Ferdinand levelled on ten minutes it began a ferocious exchange between the two sides that few could forget. Strikes from Newcastle's David Ginola and Faustino Asprilla either side of another from Fowler continued the goalfest and when Liverpool's Stan Collymore drew both sides level with just over 20 minutes remaining the game was balanced on a knife edge.

Stan Collymore (second right) is mobbed by his team-mates after all but sealing the win for the home side . Collymore celebrates the win after scoring twice against Newcastle on that memorable afternoon . In the dying embers of the match, Collymore latched on to a ball from John Barnes two minutes into injury time to score the seventh goal of the game; and Tyler still remembers the moment the Kop went wild. 'I get goosebumps every time I hear it because it was such a special time.

6211,332498f476d2fd1a0aa76b08b1a3bc698f34b7e9,"A celebrity reporter for CBS filed a lawsuit against two of his bosses at the network this week, claiming one drunkenly groped and kissed him at a Christmas party and that the other aggressively came onto him during an after-hours meeting. Kenneth Lombardi, who goes by Ken, was a red carpet regular for CBS New York, interviewing stars from Oprah to Ashton Kutcher and Arnold Schwarzenegger. However Lombardi, who is openly bisexual, says he was forced to quit his job in November and relocate to Los Angeles after two alleged sexual harassment involving two separate male bosses. Lawsuit: Kenneth Lombardi, a former entertainment reporter at CBS, claims he was sexually harassed by two male colleagues and that the network failed to reconcile his complaints. He is seen here reporting at the red carpet premiere of Arnold Schwarzenegger thriller Sabotage . Plaintiff: He also claims he was forced to leave his job as a result, and is seeking damages for violation of labor laws, emotional distress and discrimination . Furthermore he accuses the HR department at CBS of failing to reconcile either incident. The first alleged encounter occurred at a CBS Christmas party in December 2013. Lombardi claims Duane Tollison, a senior producer, grabbed his crotch and kissed his neck in front of other colleagues, The New York Daily News reported. Lombardi was upset and left the party. The next day, Tollison sent him an email, which has been included in the lawsuit. 'I wanted to apologize if anything I did offended you or crossed a line. I like to get a little crazy.

9597,e718f4c0a5c66a31d080142879bbce58fa468740,"When keen runner Julie Creffield was training for a marathon when she was a size 18, she was often heckled with taunts of 'Oi, fatty!' as she ran. Even her doctor told her she was too big to contemplate running 26.2 miles and should give up on her goal. With stories like this, it is perhaps no surprise that a new survey has found two thirds of women believe they can't run - despite being desperate to be fitter and healthier. Scroll down for video . When she was a size 18, Julie was told she was too fat to run but she completed a marathon, left, and has done numerous races since, including one at the London 2012 Olympic park, right . Julie, 37, from Stratford in East London, didn't let her critics stop her from running. She completed a marathon in 2012 - and has done numerous other races since. Now through her website, The Fat Girl's Guide To Running, she's encouraging other women to take up the sport regardless of their size and ability. She appeared on today's This Morning with sub-three hour marathoner Nell McAndrew to launch the ITV show's Run For Your Life campaign. Julie said: 'Two million more men than women in the UK play sport because women are often too worried about what they look like and fear they will be judged by others, this has to stop. 'Run For Your Life will show that anyone can find success with running, and show that women of all shapes and sizes that running can be fun and can be a great way of improving physical and mental health. And if enough women get involved and give it a go, we can really start tackling negative perceptions in our own communities. 'I was told by a doctor I was too fat to run, and just three weeks later I proved him wrong by running the Brighton Marathon, but you don't have to be able to run far or even fast to benefit from the joys of running, its all about taking part and being inspired…even if you are still a little bit rubbish at it.' Julie, back right, appeared on today's This Morning with Nell McAndrew, back left, to encourage women to take up running. Front row from left: Francesca, Kerrie and Shirley are taking up the challenge . Marathon runner Nell McAndrew encouraged the women to believe in themselves . Nell, whose Guide To Running book was published by Bloomsbury this month, added: 'Break down that barrier of being embarrassed and you will meet like-minded people in the running community. 'There's lots of support on Twitter with groups such as UK Run Chat. 'When you start running, your confidence will soon grow. I just used to go to local park and could only manage short distances but I gradually built it up. Doing races is real confidence booster so believe in yourself as you can do it.' A This Morning poll of 1000 women found that 60 per cent think they can't run yet 88 per cent would like to be fitter than they are. Seventy per cent haven't been for a run in the last year but more than 75 per cent plan on getting fitter this year. Many women are put off running because they fear they are not fit enough and are self-conscious about being seen sweating and panting while out on a jog. Julie loves running and has never let her size hold her back. She encourages other women to do the same . Others believe their size is holding them back so they don't bother - even though by taking up the sport they could lose weight. The This Morning project, like the recently launched 'This Girl Can' Sport England campaign, aims to show women they can run - even if they are currently unfit and overweight. The show will follow three novice runners - Shirley Hargan-Kennedy, 38, from Glasgow, Francesca Kennedy, 23, from Redditch, and Kerrie Jones, 37, from Cannock, Staffs - as they train for five weeks to run 5K. The show is encouraging viewers to join them on the journey by taking up running themselves. The three women revealed they currently fall into the camp of not believing they can run but want to give it a go to improve their health and wellbeing. Phillip Schofield hands out new trainers to the three woman sat on the sofa who believe they can't run but have agreed to try a five week programme culminating in a 5k race . Francesca said: 'I've tried running up and down my close and I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack.' Shirley said she wants to become like the runners she sees out training enjoying the exercise and taking in the scenic countryside when they run off-road. Overweight Kerry explained that her motivation is to partly aid weightloss, as well as to set a good example to her children. She said: 'I know I have always been fat but finding out I'm now classed as clinically obese is scary. 'I need to do this for my children, it's not about dress size anymore it's about health. Society is more accepting of big woman now but for health that's not good. 'What I hope to get from this is a new me so I'm not the fat mum at the school gates.' Julie knows how Kerry feels as she weighed 20st when she first started running in 2003. Now she is slimmer and fitter but she explains women have so much more to gain from taking up running than just weightloss. Nell looked the part as she arrived at the ITV studios in her running leggings and trainers . She said: 'I'm not a size 8 and if I can do it, so can you. Woman who take up running will come to realise it's fun and then they will want to do it more. We often hate running as it hurts but you can find ways to enjoy it. 'You have to build up gradually stop letting excuses like having bad knees or a bad back or no sports bra stopping you getting out the door. Get out and start walking then build up to running and you will see the health improvements.' Julia advised anyone who is concerned about taking up running to speak to their doctor first. To avoid injury, she also recommends wearing supportive trainers, starting slowly and stretching after running. One of the reasons many people avoid running is a fear that it's bad for their knees. But a study of 75,000 runners, which was published in Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise last year, found that 'running significantly reduced osteoarthritis and hip replacement risk due to, in part, running's association with lower BMI (Body Mass Index)'. Nell McAndrew finishing the 2012 London Marathon . 1. Invest in a good pair of trainers and some seam-free running socks. You are best going to a specialist shop for this as they will assess your running gait (or style) to find the appropriate pair. It's the only big investment you have to make and it's so important that your feet are comfortable. 2. Buy a good sports bra. Aside from running shoes, this is the other essential for women. 3. Team up with a friend so that you can support and motivate each other. If you have arranged to meet someone you'll be less likely to back out. Running with someone else also helps the minutes tick by as you have a good gossip. Alternatively look for a beginner's group or couch to 5km scheme in your area (runengland.org is a great place to start). 4. Make steady progress. If you haven't run before, download a couch to 5km programme or app (there are plenty available for free) as they advocate lots of walking and running to start with. Build up gradually, increasing your running duration by no more than 10 per cent every week. 5. Have a plan. We women are all so busy and I find it helps to sit down at the start of the week and think about what I have on each day so that I can plan when to fit in a run. It's amazing how it slots into your routine - I've jogged to school to pick up my son with my daughter in the pushchair and then jogged back as he scoots or cycles along with us. Make it work for you. 6. Log your progress. Psychologists have proven that keeping a record of your running achievements helps to spur you on. So write everything down in a diary and flick back through it when you need a boost. 7. Enter a race. OK, this is not as daunting as it sounds, I recommend everyone tries a parkrun (parkrun.org.uk) after about 5-6 weeks of running regularly. These free 5km events are held weekly at around 300 parks in the UK. 8. Be competitive. This doesn't mean you are aiming to win Olympic medals or set a record for your age group. But making targets for yourself can keep you going. It might be that you set a goal of running 5km after 6 weeks or finishing ahead of a certain person in training. It all helps hugely with motivation. 9. Eat well. One of the things I love about running regularly is that I can stay in shape without having to stick to a strict diet that forbids the eating of certain food groups. In my modelling days, the girls who were on no-carb, or no-fat diets always seemed so miserable. And sports scientists all agree that a moderate amount of carbs are essential for running. 10. Remember why you run. Maybe it's to lose weight, to raise money for charity or to de-stress. Whatever the reason, don't lose sight of it. That way when that little voice inside your head tries to stop you from heading out on a run to stay on the sofa with chocolate instead, you will overcome it. Running will empower you in a million ways. Run first and eat your chocolate afterwards (chocolate milk is proven to be a great recovery drink).

They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an 'alien' 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. 'The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,' said Alfred Galik, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. 'But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.' The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. Along with DNA evidence, the shape of the animal's skull indicated it was a hybrid .

The loot that fell into the hands of the Holy League troops and the Viennese was large. King John Sobieski vividly described in a letter to his wife a few days after the battle: . 'Ours are treasures unheard of... tents, sheep, cattle and no small number of camels... it is victory as nobody ever knew before.' Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern-day scientists were stumped by the find, it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th-century Tulln. 'The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' Galik said. While Roman-era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria, Serbia and Belgium, the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe. 'This means that the animal was not killed and then butchered. It may have been acquired as part of an exchange,' said Galik .

11449,b6907f2614e626eab5ef81c0dae5dd87df860fa7,"There is a passage in Diego Torres’s book, 'The Special One - The Secret World of Jose Mourinho', which goes a long way to understanding the practices of Chelsea’s manager. In the English version of Torres’s biography, the exchanges between Mourinho and Cristiano Ronaldo in the dressing room at Real Madrid start on page 138 and finish five pages later. Here is an abridged version of the alleged events in the team meeting before the second leg of the 2011 Champions League semi-final against Barcelona, when Ronaldo had made it clear he expected Los Blancos to be more adventurous in the Bernabeu. Jose Mourinho makes a point to Oscar and his Brazilian team-mate Willian during a game at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho has been called out by players for being too defensive before, by Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid . Oscar holds his head in his hands after missing a good chance at Stoke, where he was replaced at half time . Oscar hasn't completed a full 90 minutes for Chelsea since mid-January. Here is is full recent record: . Jan 31 Manchester City (substituted, 89) Feb 7 Aston Villa (substituted, 73) Feb 11 Everton (unused) Feb 17 Paris Saint Germain (substitute, 83) Feb 21 Burnley (substituted, 72) Mar 1 Tottenham (substitute, 88) Mar 4 West Ham (substituted, 74) Mar 11 Paris Saint Germain (substituted, 45) Mar 15 Southampton (substituted, 82) Mar 22 Hull (substitute, 61) Apr 4 Stoke (substituted, 45) According to Torres, the Real Madrid coach told his star player: ‘I’m going to say it to your face: you complain that we play defensively. But do you know why we play this way? For you. ‘Because, as you don’t want to defend or cover the wings, I have to have the team sitting deep... when you come on, you do your own thing.’ That meeting, held in the presence of the great Zinedine Zidane, apparently lasted 40 minutes. Real Madrid drew the second leg 1-1 and Barcelona progressed to the final, where they beat Manchester United 3-1 at Wembley. Team meetings are a theme of Mourinho’s management, giving his players the floor during the fallow periods that inevitably occur during the course of a long season. It is a pragmatic approach, one to be admired, unless you happen to be one of the players who challenges Mourinho’s coaching philosophy. You cannot blame Oscar, the current fall-guy, for encouraging Chelsea to play with a sense of adventure at a team meeting that took place during their wobble at the end of January. When you can call upon Oscar, Eden Hazard and Willian, why wouldn’t you? Oscar has been put back in his box in recent weeks, failing to start or finish a full 90 minutes in all competitions for Chelsea since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg on January 27. The Brazilian midfielder has failed to complete 90 minutes in any of Chelsea's last 11 games . Mourinho demands that the likes of Oscar work hard on their defensive roles to free Eden Hazard's flair . The Brazilian forward has not completed a Barclays Premier League match since the 5-0 victory at Swansea City, where he scored twice for the league leaders, 10 days earlier. Oscar put Chelsea ahead in the opening minute at the Liberty Stadium and his second, when he beat Swansea keeper Lukas Fabianski in the 36th minute from the edge of the area, is the last time he has scored. Since the 1-0 victory over Liverpool in the Capital One Cup at Stamford Bridge, Oscar has been substituted or been named substitute in 10 of Chelsea’s last 11 fixtures. Here is the record in full. Manchester City (substituted, 89); Aston Villa (substituted, 73); Paris Saint-Germain (substitute, 83); Burnley (substituted, 72); Tottenham (substitute, 88); West Ham (substituted, 74); Paris Saint-Germain (substituted, 45); Southampton (substituted, 82); Hull (substitute, 61); Stoke (substituted, 45). Against Everton, on February 11, he was not in the squad. Naturally Oscar has some concerns, worried that his views at a routine team meeting have been misinterpreted by this most demanding of managers. Oscar was disappointing during last weekend's win, and Mourinho hit out at his performance afterwards . The Chelsea star tries a fancy flick but little of what he tried came off during the win against Stoke . It is believed to have been innocuous, an observation from a player who has been a popular and respectful member of the Chelsea dressing room since his move from Internacional in 2012. He is certainly not regarded as a troublemaker. It was Oscar, after all, who is so highly-regarded by the coaching staff at Chelsea that he was considered a potential, future rival to the annual duel between Lionel Messi and Ronaldo for the Ballon d’Or. When Oscar returned from the World Cup, where he scored the 90th minute goal for his country in their 7-1 rout by Germany in the semi-final, his first-class attitude to the new season was noted by coaching staff. Despite the disappointment over the summer with the national team, he was eager to please Mourinho as he entered his third season with Chelsea. In November, his sparkling form was rewarded with a new five-year contract, a move designed to keep him in that role off the main striker, Diego Costa, until 2019. All was well. Oscar was dejected after Brazil's World Cup semi final defeat, but he returned to Chelsea with a good attitude . The Chelsea midfielder suggested the side should be more positive with the likes of Eden Hazard and Willian . When Oscar arrived at the club he was thought of as a future Ballon d'Or winner, but his place is now in doubt . There is a touch of Brian Clough about Mourinho’s attitude towards him, a nod in the direction of the famous response he gave when asked about the way he dealt with disaffected players. ‘We talk about it for 20 minutes and then we decide I was right all along,’ Clough once remarked. Oscar is certainly learning all about that as he deals with Mourinho’s mood swings. ‘No, I don’t think he had a bad performance, I just think his performance was not good enough, which is a huge difference,’ claimed Chelsea’s manager after their 2-1 victory over Stoke City on Saturday. Naturally there is a little uncertainty about Oscar’s performances at the moment, reluctant to try anything out of the ordinary because of the potential consequences. Oscar knows, like everyone else knows, that if you take on Mourinho, he will take you off.","Oscar spoke up against defensive Chelsea tactics in a team meeting .

8206,3543fec61fb468c9fceaa558ebf576bf6501c169,"David Cameron this morning attempted to explain away how he forgot which football team he supported - by claiming it was because he'd seen another club's ground the day before. The Prime Minister, who insists he has been an Aston Villa fan 'all his life', was giving a campaign speech in south London on Saturday when he joked that everyone should back his team – but then named West Ham instead of the West Midlands giants. An embarrassed Mr Cameron this morning admitted he couldn't explain what happened - but said it must have been because he had been past West Ham's famous Upton Park ground in East London on Friday. It later emerged that the Prime Minister actually flew over the ground in a private helicopter charted to get him back to London quickly after a day's campaigning. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, appearing on ITV's Lorraine this morning, was ridiculed  after  appearing to forget which football team he supported . The Prime Minister tried to explain away his gaffe by saying he had driven by the West Ham stadium the day before . Appearing on ITV's Lorraine, the PM said: 'I had been past West Ham the day before - I can't understand it, but there we are.' But he added: 'I don't think these are the things that determine the election.' A senior Conservative source told MailOnline the PM had not returned to London on Friday on the party's battle bus - but had flown back from Clacton-on-Sea. On Mr Cameron's flight back from Essex - paid for out of Conservative Party funds - he is likely to have passed over the old West Ham ground. Earlier in the day, Mr Cameron had travelled to Lincoln on the train, before jumping on the battle bus for campaign stops in Colchester and Frinton upon Sea. Mr Cameron had earlier insisted he became a Villa fan after watching the team beat Bayern Munich in the European Cup final as a child. But when he was asked what year the match took place or who scored the winner, Mr Cameron refused to answer. The Prime Minister claimed he had been 'overcome by something', adding: 'It was just one of those things.' He said he had gone 'off script' with the remark adding: 'I suppose it's just the campaign. By the time you have made as many speeches as I have on this campaign all sorts of funny things start popping out of your mouth.' An aerial view of Upton Park home of West Ham United Football Club in East London - which Mr Cameron flew over by helicopter on the way back from Clacton, Essex, on Friday afternoon . Mr Cameron has been pictured watching football with his son Elwyn - but admitted that he does not go to live games very often . Mr Cameron  claimed he became a Villa fan after watching the team beat Bayern Munich in the 1982 European Cup final - but admitted he could not remember the year of the triumph. Peter Withe, left, scored the only goal of the match, and Nigel Spinks the reserve 'keeper performed heroics . David Cameron's uncle Sir William Dugdale . David Cameron said he started supporting Aston Villa because his uncle was 'involved in the club'. In fact, the Prime Minister's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. In the final year of his chairmanship, Villa beat the odds to win the European Cup. Mr Cameron said he remembered the glory days back in the early 80s'. He said the star players Andy Gray and Brian Little 'got me going'. At the time of the gaffe, Mr Cameron likened himself to the Green Party leader Natalie Bennett, who infamously blamed a 'brain fade' after a disastrous interview. He said: 'I had what Natalie would describe as a brain fade – I don't know what happened to me. I think I was overcome by something. But these things sometimes happen when you're on the stump.' Labour said the gaffe exposed the Prime Minister as a 'phoney'. Former Downing Street spin chief Alastair Campbell claimed it 'says a lot about his character', adding: 'Out of touch. Phoney. Believes nothing.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, a Norwich City fan, tweeted: 'Hey David Cameron... I'm off to see that football team I support this afternoon. Name escapes me... they play in yellow... Watford?' But Mr Cameron, interviewed by Sky News host Dermot Murnaghan yesterday, said: 'My uncle was involved in the club and back in the early 80s and all those successes - Andy Gray and Brian Little got me going. 'I don't go very often - in fact I haven't been for years and years - but I do try to keep up. We're going to escape the relegation zone, which we're out of now - and the cup final is very exciting.' Mr Cameron's late uncle Sir William Dugdale was Aston Villa's chairman from 1975 to 1982. Reminded of his comment in 2001 in the House of Commons that he wasn't actually a football fan, Mr Cameron said: 'I mean, I'm not a regular attender, I used to play football as a kid, my son plays football, and I try and sort of keep up with what's happening in the Premier League and see how Villa are doing. 'But when they get snug in the middle of the table I tend to sort of, I tend to back off a bit. When we get close to the bottom I get nervous, but I don't know what happened.' Mr Cameron was asked to show his support for Aston Villa by naming the year of the club's famous European Cup final victory in 1982. The PM said: 'It was early 80s, I'm not going to give you a date because I'll get it wrong.' He added: 'I'm not doing quiz time.' Mr Cameron made the gaffe in a speech on multiculturalism in the UK – claiming it was possible to support a number of teams at the same time and still be British. He said: 'You can support Man United, the Windies and Team GB all at the same time.' But he then added: 'Of course I'd rather you supported West Ham.' Speaking on the Murnaghan programme broadcast yesterday morning, Mr Cameron tried to explain away the gaffe. He said: 'I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life, I literally opened my mouth and I was going off-piste about the fact that in Britain you can be a supporter of the West Indies, a supporter of Manchester United, and a supporter of Team GB.'","David Cameron this weekend forgot which football team he supported .

Many firemen have not been trained in basic first aid – yet they are being left to care for seriously ill elderly patients for hours while they wait for an ambulance. The Fire Brigades Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous but is becoming increasingly common because the ambulance service is so overstretched. The ambulance service is becoming increasingly reliant on firemen to attend life-threatening emergencies . The Fire Brigade Union say the practice is irresponsible and dangerous and becoming more common . Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E. They normally carry a few blankets, oxygen masks to protect against smokes and a defibrillator – to restart the heart. In one case earlier this year an elderly lady is feared to have died because she was left in the hands of fire crews for nearly 40 minutes while paramedics were delayed. The ambulance service is facing unprecedented demand from the rising and aging population and in some areas 999 calls are up by 15 per cent on last year. Paramedics are also having to respond to rising numbers of non-urgent calls from patients frustrated that they cannot get an appointment with their GP. They are also having to waste much of their time queued up outside A&E units which cannot accept their patients because staff there are also very busy. This has all led to the ambulance service increasingly relying on firemen to attend potentially life-threatening emergencies. The Fire Brigades Union yesterday warned that South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue were sending firemen with no medical training to 999 calls instead of ambulances. It pointed out that only a third of firefighters at this branch had any medical training – and even this only consisted of a four day course of basic first aid. Yet in one case they were left to help an elderly lady who had stopped breathing for 45 minutes whilst they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Senior union officials say fire engines are routinely being turned into makeshift ambulances to ferry patients to A&E . In another, they tended to a pensioner who had fallen and banged her head for two hours before they were forced to leave her on her own – to attend a fire. The practice is occurring across the country and last July, firemen took a 16-year-old girl with suspected bleeding on the brain to A&E in Warrington, Cheshire . In December, crews were sent to a care home in Ryde on the Isle of Wight where an elderly woman had a stroke and were ordered to cut the rings off her fingers which were turning blue because of poor blood flow. Ian Murray, vice-president of the Fire Brigades Union – which represents 44,000 firemen – said: 'We know only a small percentage of firefighters are trained to give basic first aid. 'It is irresponsible and dangerous to put untrained firefighters in the position of attending incidents to assist the ambulance service, with the knowledge that it is highly unlikely one will arrive for some considerable time.' In January, a woman of 84 from Doncaster is feared to have died because firemen were sent to her home rather than an ambulance. Paramedics did not show up for 40 minutes after which time her pulse had stopped. Last month the Mail revealed how London Ambulance Service had resorted to flying half way round the world to Australia to hire 225 paramedics because it is so overstretched.","The Fire Brigades Union say practice is irresponsible and dangerous .

Coral Jones, 43, whose daughter was snatched from outside her home in Machynlleth, Powys, had letters demanding her other children be taken into care. She was branded a 'bad mother' for allowing April to play in the street past 7pm where she was abducted and killed by paedophile Mark Bridger. Scroll down for video . Coral Jones, pictured with her husband, Paul, 46, has revealed she has been sent hate mail blaming her for the murder of her five-year-old daughter April and demanding her other children are taken into care . Mrs Jones said: 'We had a letter with no name on it and no address to write to, saying I was a bad mother and it was my fault and I shouldn't have my other children with me. 'Yes, I blame myself every day for it but unless they live in my shoes they have no right to tell me I am a bad mother.' She admitted that she blames herself for letting April stay out on her bike 'for an extra 15 minutes' after getting a good school report that day in October 2012. Bridger, 49, who took her to his cottage nearby and killed her, was jailed for life in 2013 but despite the largest police search in British history her body has never been recovered. April Jones, left, was abducted from outside her home by Mark Bridger, right, who was jailed for life in 2013 . Mrs Jones and husband Paul, 46, told BBC Wales programme Week In Week Out they have battled to live a normal life for their two children Jazmin, 19, and Harley, 12, after the tragedy. Since the loss of her daughter, Mrs Jones has suffered from agroraphobia and will not leave the house on her own. Mr Jones said: 'It is not often she will go anywhere on her own. Even just to pop down the shops one of the kids will go with her or I will go with her or she will call a friend.' Mrs Jones added: 'I get frightened and feel unsafe that people come up to me. I know they mean no harm but when people come up to me and I am feeling frightened, I can't cope.' She admitted that the only place in her town she feels comfortable is April's favourite local sweet shop. 'He [Bridger] didn't just take April away from us - he took her away from the town,' she said. 'I shouldn't be like this because of him but I cannot help it.' April's older sister Jazmin explained her family were still struggling to come to terms with her murder. The family has said they have struggled to come to terms with April's death. Coral and Paul Jones are pictured with their eldest daughter, Jazmin, 19, (left) and 13-year-old Harley (second left) She said: 'One day I could be really happy and Dad could be really upset and we would argue, we would shout at each other. We would want to hit someone or something just to get the anger out.' The Jones' have launched a campaign to highlight the growing problem of internet abuse after their daughter's killer was found to have accessed child abuse images online hours before her death. Mr Jones told the BBC he thought part of preventing the issue rested with potential offenders, who should identify themselves to authorities to get support. He said: 'If you have got the notion that you like kids like that or anything like that, if you go and ask for help then you deserve a chance. But if you don't ask for help and you commit a crime then you are a paedophile.' Last year, the Jones family joined Madeleine McCann's parents, Gerry and Kate, to back the nationwide Child Rescue Alert with the charity Missing People.","Coral Jones, 43, has had anonymous letters branding her a 'bad mother'

1950,b31dcb67787992763ae479376cf3d53695af41ff,"Israeli scholars are furious after new flooring was fitted 'behind their backs' by the Muslim authority in charge of Judaism's holiest site - potentially covering up clues to the location of the 'Lost Ark'. The work at the Dome of the Rock was simply meant to replace carpet, worn away by thousands of pilgrims at the gold-topped shrine, which overlooks old Jerusalem. But when the old carpet was lifted, it revealed previously undocumented ancient floor designs - which could point to where the gold-cased Ark of the Covenant was buried 2,500 years ago. The discovery of the cryptic geometric patterns immediately caught the attention of some researchers, thrilled at the possibility of solving the Indiana Jones-type mystery which touches upon a holy grail for biblical enthusiasts. Scroll down for video . Hidden: Workers place carpets over ancient floor designs in the cave under the Dome of the Rock, which Israeli scholars are angry they did not get the chance to document before they were covered . Legend: Scholars have suggested the flooring may give a clue as to where the Ark of the Covenant - imagined here in the 1981 Indiana Jones film - is hidden, which Jewish tradition says is buried under the Dome . 'Something is there. I don't know what. But something is hidden there,' said Israeli archaeologist Zachi Dvira, who studies the site. Yet it looks likely it will remain a mystery: scholars did not get the chance to document the designs before workmen began laying the new carpet, paid for by King Abdullah II of Jordan, the country which remains the custodian of the area's Muslim holy sites. It has sparked a war of words between the Waqf, the Muslim authority that administers the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, which includes the Dome of the Rock, and Israeli archaeological authorities, who say the repairs were carried out behind their backs. The scholars also fear the glue being used may permanently damage the floor. Israel's housing minister Uri Ariel, of the nationalist Jewish Home party, waded in to the argument to urge an immediate halt to the work. In an alarmed letter sent to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week, he wrote: 'There is no need to elaborate on how important this site is, where every modification, every excavation with heavy equipment can cause irreparable harm to the foundations of the Temple.' Row: The Dome of the Rock is one of the most contentious religious spots in all of Jerusalem, and the argument over the carpet is simply the latest in a long line of battle between Muslim and Jewish groups . Holy: The Dome of the Rock and its hilltop plaza is considered Judaism's holiest spot and Islam's third holiest . But the Waqf reject the accusations. Sheikh Azzam Tamimi, the head of the Waqf, said the work is long overdue and has defiantly proclaimed that he was forbidding any Israeli involvement. 'Our work in Al Aqsa is transparent,' he said. 'We are only putting down carpet and felt. Nothing more, nothing less.' They also deny the work will cause any damage. Jamal Al Quda, a member of a group of Jordanian carpet layers who received Israeli visas for the job,  said it was necessary to affix the base layer of thin dark felt before rolling out the carpet above it. 'It comes off my hand,' he added, rubbing his fingers. Heritage: The Dome is thought to be one of the most interesting archaeological sites in Jerusalem . Finance: This latest work, pictured last Sunday, is being paid for by King Abdullah II of Jordan . This is not the first time tensions have flared over work at the Dome of the Rock. The Dome of the Rock is at the centre of competing claims. Muslims believe it enshrines the large rock slab where Muslim tradition says the Prophet Muhammad ascended to heaven. Meanwhile, Jews believe the rock may be where the holiest part of the two ancient Temples stood as early as about 3,000 years ago — and where religious Jews pray a third Temple will one day be built. Ancient Jewish traditions say the Ark of the Covenant. which contained the Ten Commandments, may have been hidden away in a chamber when the First Jewish Temple was destroyed. The adjacent Western Wall, believed to be one of the last remnants of the Temple complex, is the holiest site where Jews can pray. But Palestinian officials reject Jewish historical ties to the site and the competing claims have been known to spill over into violence. While Jerusalem may be the most excavated city in the world, the Dome and its hilltop plaza are an archaeological goldmine which has never been properly dug because of the political sensitivities surrounding the site, which is considered Judaism's holiest spot and Islam's third holiest. In 1999, the Muslim authorities who administer the site dug an enormous hole 12 metres, or 40 feet, deep as part of construction for an underground prayer area, dumping 10,000 tons of earth in a nearby valley and an east Jerusalem dump. The director of the Israeli Antiquities Authority at the time called it an 'archaeological crime'. For years, Dvira and veteran Israeli archaeologist Gabriel Barkay have been leading a team of archaeologists and volunteers in combing through the dirt for historical finds. The initiative, called the Temple Mount Sifting Project, is conducted under the auspices of the Elad Foundation, a group that also purchases Arab homes in contested parts of East Jerusalem and helps move Jews in. Critics say this nationalist agenda should not mix with archaeology. Israel's state comptroller wrote a scathing report in 2010 about the Muslim authorities' illicit work projects at the compound and Israel's failure at enforcing supervision there. Israeli officials kept the report classified out of concern that its publication could harm the sensitive relationship with Jordan. Tens of thousands of worshippers attend weekly Friday prayers, and the carpets have been replaced before — most recently 12 years ago, at a time of heightened violence when Israeli antiquities officials were granted limited access to the site. Social media: Leaked photos of the work have fuelled this latest argument between the two sides . Past renovation projects were done quietly behind the scenes. Leaked photos posted on social media sites — combined with the political influence of Israeli nationalists monitoring the site — drew extra attention and fuelled the latest controversy. Photos that were leaked to Facebook from the off-limits restoration site showed a number of geometric floor patterns never before documented by archaeologists, said Frankie Snyder, a researcher with the Temple Mount Sifting Project. Some apparently date to when the Crusaders controlled the complex in the 12th century, she said. 'I'm worried about damage of the original floors,' said Barkay, the archaeologist. 'The patterns were never properly documented.' Israel Hasson, the director of the Israeli Antiquities Authority, said once the government body learned about the renovation, it made arrangements with the Waqf to send an archaeologist to document some of the floor patterns, but others already had been covered by the maroon and beige carpeting. 'We got to part of them. We didn't get to it all. I won't ask anyone to pull up the carpets to document it,' Hasson said. 'We will wait for the next opportunity. We're sure to be here over the next 2,000 years.'","Row erupted after mysterious geometric designs discovered under carpet .

2442,8f7a12eac9db135f01edf48a9f0e7a18e59fb9d4,"A Utah man is thankful he is alive after he claims a Delta Airlines plane flew over his home when a large chunk of ice dropped from the aircraft shattering his car's windshield. Todd Larson, 55, told Daily Mail Online he had parked his collectible Dodge Challenger worth $30,000 in the driveway of his Taylorsville home on March 25 when moments later an ice chunk crashed onto his car at 1.53am. 'It hit so hard that four or five neighbors' car alarms went off,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'It missed going through my roof by only inches and if I had stayed in the car and answered by son’s message about picking him up, that piece of ice would have gone right through my chest.' Todd Larson said a chunk of ice fell from a plan smashing through the windshield of his Dodge Challenger parked at his Taylorsville, Utah home (above his damaged Dodge Challenger) He said the FAA did an investigation and found an A1 aircraft that matched within two minutes of the time the incident happened and when the plane was flying above his home . Mr Larson said two minutes later at 1.55am he called police to file the report of the ice chunk falling through his car's windshield, which he believes came from a Delta Airlines A1 aircraft. He earlier told Fox 13 there were four Delta Air Line flights in the area when the incident occurred, according to a representative for the Federal Aviation Administration. On Friday afternoon, Mr Larson told Daily Mail Online that the FAA did an investigation and learned that on March 26 an aircraft within two minutes of the time of incident was in the area above his home. 'The investigator cannot give me the flight number but the time it happened matched within two minutes that the plane was overhead,' he said. 'What caught my attention was that as he turned the plane and put his spoiler down, you could hear the engine change, and I looked up and saw that it was a Delta plane. 'Then I heard a huge crash which sounded like a major car accident.' Mr Larson said the hole in his windshield is about 12.5 inches in length and that the size of the piece of ice that went through was the size of a cinder block. 'The pieces that broke up were the size of a grapefruit and the smaller ones were the size of golf balls,' he told Daily Mail Online. Mr Larson has already paid the $4,000 in repairs which included $400 for the windshield and additional costs for replacing his Bluetooth, emergency phone and electric power seat with a heater that were all damaged in the incident. 'When you’re retired and you have to take that big chunk of money out it makes a big difference in what you can do,' he said. 'You try and stay on a budget and you find a car that you really wanted and it’s damaged in this way. 'My insurance says yes they’ll fix it, but my agent explained to me what happens and told me to call FAA, and said if I didn’t make a claim my car would be worthless so I’m at Catch-22. 'I don’t know why they can’t admit what they did.' Mr Larson said the chunks of ice ranged in size from grapefruits to golf balls (above the chunks of ice following the incident) He said the hole in his windshield is about 12.5 inches in length and that the glass was shattered into a fine powder . Mr Larson said that he has contacted Delta Airlines and the person in charge of the aircraft has not returned his calls. He said they are meant to respond within ten working days, and that after giving them 15, he is left fed up. 'They don’t want to recognize it as their mistake that something happened from their plane,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'One of the people who did the preliminary investigation explained that if it was a part or a panel they are responsible, but ice is an ""act of God"" or cause of nature. 'I said it could be a malfunction in the plane and they won’t recognize that or give me a call back. 'I want them to admit that it was their fault.' Daily Mail Online calls to Delta Airlines on Friday were not immediately returned. Mr Larson said he wants Delta Airlines to admit the chunk of ice came from their aircraft. On Friday, he told Daily Mail Online he had not had calls returned from the person in charge of the airbus . An incident similar to Larson's occurred earlier this year, when large pieces of ice slammed down into a man's Chicago living room and bedroom, causing destruction including a massive hole in his ceiling. John Connors said apart from his cat Oscar being left scared, who was uninjured during the incident in January, if he had been home he would have been killed. 'I walked in and it looked like a bomb had exploded up in here,' Connors told WLS. At the time, pilot Scott Batzel told Lake View Patch that he thought the ice dropped through Connors' apartment because of a plane flying overhead. Batzel said: 'There’s a slight possibility the ice-ball fell from an airplane. It’s not a common occurrence but it does happen from time to time. 'It’s very likely that many arriving airplanes were operating in that vicinity.' He added: 'Some airplanes use potable water to flush the lavatory toilets. 'Normally the flushed waste is collected in a storage tank but if the tank was leaking, ice could have built up on the outside of the plane and eventually broke free.' In January, John Connors (pictured above with his cat Oscar) experienced a similar incident when ice pummeled through his Chicago apartment leaving his cat Oscar scared  and a massive hole in his ceiling .","Todd Larson, 55, of Taylorsville, Utah claims Delta A1 aircraft flew over his home dropping ice chunk smashing his Dodge Challenger's windshield .

10588,d5085afd780c10029dd7a40c1c8d2b112656be38,"Raheem Sterling arrived at Liverpool's Melwood base for training on Wednesday after the latest twist to his controversy-ridden season. Sterling has escaped a club punishment after being caught on video inhaling the legal high nitrous oxide, but fresh pictures have emerged of him holding a shisha pipe, this time alongside young team-mate Jordon Ibe. Sterling, 20, and Ibe, 19, were pictured during what is believed to be a visit to a shisha cafe in London earlier this season. The teenager was spotted arriving at Melwood on Wednesday just seconds after Sterling. Ibe was driving a black Range Rover while Sterling arrived in a white version of the same model. Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling pictured arriving at training on Wednesday morning . Sterling arrived at Melwood in a white Range Rover after fresh pictures emerged of him with a shisha pipe . Jordon Ibe at Melwood on Wednesday after he was also pictured alongside Sterling holding a shisha . Sterling is expected to meet Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers on Thursday and he will be reminded of his professional responsibilities and warned about the consequences of taking a drug that has been called ‘hippy crack’. Rodgers questioned Sterling’s professionalism on Monday after footage emerged of the 20-year-old unconscious in his house in Southport having taken nitrous oxide with two unnamed friends. Liverpool players Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe . This is the second time Sterling has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days . Shisha is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal. The tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly. The flavoured tobacco smells sweet, making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience, according to enthusiasts. Despite the smoke passing through water, all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases, as well as cancer. During an hour-long Shisha smoking session, it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes. It has been a chastening week for Sterling. Pictures were published on Sunday of him smoking a shisha pipe and then a different set of images surfaced on Tuesday of Sterling and Ibe. Casually dressed, the pair are sat on a sofa in front of a table with shisha pipes, cans of fizzy Fanta orange and a portable music speaker. Ibe, wearing a red hoodie and ripped black jeans, is pictured holding a shisha pipe. He is sitting next to Sterling, who is wearing a tight white v-neck t-shirt and blue jeans, on the sofa. The pair can be seen smiling and joking as they hold on to the pipes in the bar. The pictures are believed to have been taken last September. Liverpool offered no comment on those photos. The club maintain the matter will be dealt with internally but he is not going to be fined. Sterling enraged Liverpool after saying in a BBC interview that he was ‘flattered’ to be linked with Arsenal. It is understood, however, that Arsenal have gone cold on Sterling, who scored in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over Newcastle on Monday. All talks about his future have been put on hold until the end of the campaign but Ian Ayre, Liverpool’s chief executive, issued a strong line yesterday, insisting that Sterling — who has turned down a contract in the region of £100,000 per week — would be at Anfield for a ‘long time’. Ayre said: ‘Raheem’s agent has asked that we park all discussions regarding his future until the summer. We respect that. Raheem is a Liverpool player and has two years left on his contract. We expect Raheem Sterling to be here for a long time.’ It appears that Sterling and Ibe each have a shisha pipe and are also drinking Fanta . Sterling was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend . Sterling was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as 'hippy crack' Shisha pipes are used to smoke fruit-flavoured tobacco, which is burned on hot coals, through a long tube. They are commonly used in the Middle East. It is said that one single shisha session is equal to smoking around 200 cigarettes, which calls into question the professionalism of any athlete using the pipe. The British Heart Foundation website it clearly states: ‘Like cigarettes [shisha] contains nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide and heavy metals, such as arsenic and lead.' Sterling, who has 14 caps for England, was pictured on a social media site with the picture captioned ‘1 down 3 to go’, suggesting he did not just take a single drag on the pipe.

3026,84a933b7edc70c7f5e6ed6558c7b57c100abc114,"(CNN)The officer charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed black man in South Carolina has been fired as anger continues to build around his case. A video shows Officer Michael Slager, who is white, firing eight shots at 50-year-old Walter Scott as Scott has his back to him and is running away. Scott, who was unarmed, was struck five times. Timeline of events . The FBI is investigating, and once again, a shooting involving police has sparked national outrage. ""I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,"" North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters Wednesday. The mayor spoke at the same news conference that was repeatedly interrupted by protesters, who chanted: ""No justice! No peace!"" They called for Mayor Keith Summey to step down. Summey told reporters that the city has ordered an additional 150 body cameras ""so every officer on the street"" in the city will have one. That is in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered, he said. Just before the conference was set to begin, demonstrators walked in. They were led by a man wearing a ""Black Lives Matter"" T-shirt who shouted, ""This is what democracy looks like!"" Scott's shooting stirred memories of the Michael Brown case in Ferguson, Missouri, where an unarmed black teenager was killed by a white police officer. A grand jury declined to indict the officer in that case. But not everyone agreed that Scott's case is like Brown's or that race was a factor. ""We can't get into the brain of another individual, so we can't state that,"" Scott family attorney Chris Stewart said. ""I think it would be irresponsible to say that and try and inflame a community or anything of that nature."" An autopsy of Scott showed that he ""sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the back of his body,"" and his death was the result of a homicide, the Charleston County Coroner's Office said. Asked whether CPR was performed on Scott after Slager shot him, Driggers said: ""In the end of it (the video), what I saw was (what I) believed to be a police officer removing the shirt of the individual and performing some type of life-saving (procedure), but I'm not sure what took place there."" The North Charleston Police department was not legally obligated to but chose to hand the case over to the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, according to a news release from Scarlett A. Wilson, the Ninth Judicial Circuit solicitor. Though Wilson said she is subject to rules that limit what she can say publicly, she stated: ""My role is to hold accountable those who harm others unlawfully, regardless of profession. This office does not dictate nor comment upon police policy, training and procedure. I am, however, deeply concerned when those who are sworn to serve and protect violate the public's trust."" Slager pulled Scott over on Saturday morning for a broken taillight, authorities have said. The beginning of the video shows the two men standing close to each other. Any words exchanged between Scott and Slager are not audible on the released tape. It's also unclear what happened before Scott started to run away, or why he ran. The officer initially said that he used a Taser stun gun on Scott and that Scott tried to take his weapon. ""Shots fired and the subject is down,"" Slager said, according to police reports. ""He took my Taser."" Before the officer started firing his gun, a dark object falls behind him and hits the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when the officer approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. When Scott's brother Anthony saw the video, he was convinced the officer had lied, he told CNN. ""There was not a struggle for the Taser,"" Anthony Scott said. ""I didn't believe my brother would have done that anyway."" To  Anthony Scott, the videotape shows his brother was ""running for his life"" away from the officer. ""I think my brother was thinking he was not going to be shot, no one would have thought that,"" Scott said. The video shows Walter Scott attempting to run away. His back is to the officer, and he is a few yards away when the officer raises his gun and fires. A man walking to work on Saturday recorded the video and provided it to the family. That man, Feidin Santana, spoke to NBC's Lester Holt. He said there had been a struggle between the two men on the ground before he started recording, and that the officer was in control. When asked how he felt about the fact that Slager has been charged with murder, Santana said that ""no one can feel happy."" ""He has his family and Mr. Scott also has his family. But I think, you know, he made a bad decision. And, you know, you pay for your decisions in this life,"" he told NBC's Holt. ""Mr. Scott didn't deserve this. And there were other ways that can be used to get him arrested. And that wasn't the proper way to do that."" If convicted of murder, Slager could face life in prison or the death penalty. Who is Officer Slager? ""People are upset, people are pointing out how wrong the officer was for gunning down Mr. Scott,"" South Carolina State Rep. Justin Bamberg said as he stood alongside Anthony Scott on Wednesday. #WalterScott received 11,000 mentions on Twitter in just one hour Wednesday; 243,000 mentions in 24 hours. #RIPWalterScott is also trending, as is #MichaelSlager. Bamberg said he hasn't heard of anyone acting out violently to protest the shooting. He and Scott stressed they don't want that to happen. ""Things are in play now, and this officer is in the process of being prosecuted,"" Bamberg said, imploring anyone listening to him speak on CNN: ""We ask that you let the justice process run its course."" That message was echoed by Walter Scott's mother, who said she feels ""forgiveness in my heart, even for the guy that shot and killed my son."" ""He was a loving son, a loving father. He cared about his family and ... no matter what happens, it will not replace my son,"" Judy Scott told CNN's Anderson Cooper. The Justice Department said it would ""take appropriate action in light of the evidence and developments in the state case."" ""The South Carolina Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation concurrent with the S.C. Law Enforcement Division and are providing aid as necessary to the state investigation,"" the Justice Department said in a statement. ""The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the South Carolina U.S. Attorney's Office will work with the FBI in the investigation."" Whether Scott's civil rights were violated will be part of the Justice Department's investigation. In the meantime, Slager remains behind bars. He was denied bail at a bond hearing Tuesday night, CNN affiliate WCIV reported. Slager will remain in custody unless a circuit court sets his bond, a court spokesman told CNN. The court has not set a date for that hearing. According to WCIV, Slager initially said through his attorney, David Aylor, that he followed the appropriate policies and procedures. But Aylor later told CNN that he no longer represents the officer. It's not clear whether Slager has found a new attorney. A CNN examination of Slager's police job application indicates he has been an employee of the North Charleston Police Department for about five years and five months. Instead of wearing his police uniform, Slager now wears a jail uniform. Who was Walter Scott? CNN's Ryan Scallan, Christine Bear, Tristan Smith, Martin Savidge, Dana Ford, Sam Stringer, Randi Kaye, Chandler Friedman, Evan Perez, Don Lemon and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.","Witness who took the video says ""Mr. Scott didn't deserve this""

2820,a3d8942def42170614720f6322f80fe06a9359e8,"Nick Clegg tonight set out the first of his 'red lines' for a second coalition, warning he will block any cut in education spending. The Liberal Democrats admitted today that their best hope is to end up with 30-something MPs after May 7, compared with the 57 elected in 2010. A senior party source said their best chance of holding the balance of power after the General Election was to finish 'in the 30s' if they are able to retain a number of closely-fought seats. Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, making play dough at Tops Day Nursery, Corfe Mullen in Dorset, said he would demand education spending be protected from cuts as the price of propping up another coalition . Mr Clegg said the first of what he dubbed his 'Premier League policies' is a £5billion commitment to protect the entire education budget in real terms. But Mr Clegg is still determined to form a coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour and today vowed to set out which of the policies announced in his manifesto would be non-negotiable. The first of what he dubbed his 'Premier League policies', which the party would insist upon as a condition of propping up a government, is a £5billion commitment to protect the entire education budget in real terms. It would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards and at all stages 'from cradle to college', which goes further than the Tories or Labour have promised. Mr Clegg said: 'I can confirm a Liberal Democrat red line – a pre-condition for Government – is increasing spending on education. 'The Liberal Democrats will not allow our children and grandchildren to pay the price of this generation's mistakes. We believe above all else in spreading opportunity, in tearing down the barriers that stop people from reaching their potential. Nothing is more crucial to that than education.' The Lib Dem leader - who claimed just last week that he would not set out 'red lines' - said people felt 'confused' about the outcome of the election and he wanted to be 'clear and certain' about his party's intentions. The pledge would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards and at all stages 'from cradle to college', which goes further than the Tories or Labour have promised . The Liberal Democrats admitted today that their best hope is to end up with 30-something MPs after May 7, compared with the 57 elected in 2010 . Inviting criticism that the rest of his policies are all negotiable, he said he would fight for everything in the manifesto but that 'here are some Premier League policies and others which don't assume quite the same significance'. 'I will confirm the non-negotiables, the deal breakers, the things without which we would not enter into a coalition government and I'll do so fairly rapidly over the next few days', he said. Mr Clegg's policy is £5billion more expensive that what the Conservatives had planned – which is a freeze on schools spending for those aged 5 to 16 and cuts in other areas. It is £2.5bn more than Labour planned to spend on protecting the entire education budget but not accounting for an expected 460,000 rise in pupil numbers over the next five years. 'The next Government must increase spending on nurseries, schools and colleges. That means education spending must rise with both prices and pupil numbers', he said. 'Without investment in education, there can be no deal with the Liberal Democrats.' The pledge would take education funding from £49bn a year currently to more than £55 by the end of the next Parliament, to be funded by rising economic growth once the deficit is cleared. A promise on education spending is intended to win over floating voters in key seats where the Lib Dems are facing the Tories, to capitalise on concerns about cuts to public services. A senior lib dem involved in party strategy said the campaign's focus was increasingly on 10 to 15 marginal seats. Mr Clegg would not comment on numbers of seats and simply said his party would do better than dire opinion polls suggest.","Clegg names the first of his 'Premier League policies' as price of support .

The Manchester City captain and winner of two Premier League titles at the Etihad Stadium, was the subject of an inquiry from Sir Alex Ferguson when he was breaking through the ranks at Anderlecht. But Kompany admits that his mother insisted he finishes school before to England, and he says 'everything has played out perfectly' after he eventually sealed a switch to the Premier League in 2008. Vincent Kompany (centre) says his mum stopped him moving to Manchester United as a teenager . The Belgian international broke into Anderlecht's first team at a young age and was highly-coveted . He told the Daily Mirror: 'United asked about me, but I had other priorities at the time. I was studying for my A-levels and my mother made me finish my education before I could concentrate on football.

Sterling said on Wednesday that he was not ready to sign a new £100,000-a-week deal at Liverpool and described links with Arsenal as ‘quite flattering’. Former Manchester United midfielder Scholes hailed Sterling as a good player but says he does not score enough goals and needs to focus on playing every week rather than move to a bigger club and not play. Raheem Sterling says he is not ready to sign a new deal at Liverpool . Paul Scholes has advised Sterling to stay at Liverpool and continue to develop . Sterling arrives for training at Liverpool's Melwood training ground ahead of this week's Arsenal clash . Scholes says Sterling should concentrate on playing every week for Liverpool . Writing in his Independent column, Scholes said: ‘When it comes to his future, my view is that Raheem Sterling should stay at Liverpool. They have elevated him from the junior sides and he has a manager who has built a team around him. He plays every week. What more do you need at that age? ‘Sterling is a good player. He can beat a man and on his day he looks impressive. But he doesn’t score enough goals, not yet anyway. ‘You have to be careful when you time a move to one of the biggest clubs. Occasionally, these young players do not realise what a good thing they are on to when they know that they will be playing every week.’ Liverpool are infuriated by Sterling's decision to give an interview to the BBC without even telling them and some members of the club's hierarchy are convinced that the England international and his representatives are simply preparing the way for a move this summer. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers shakes hands with Sterling as he leaves the pitch . Stirling says his refusal to sign a contract is not about money . Sterling says he wants to win trophies in his career . 'It's not about the money at all,' Sterling said. 'It's never been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That's all I talk about. 'I don't talk about how many cars I'm going to drive, how many houses I've got. I just purely want to be the best I can be. 'I don't want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old. 'I try to kill it off, but I don't think the public can see it that way. 'I think they just see it as this 20-year-old boy being greedy. 'I just want to take the time to think about what I've achieved in my career so far, where I need to go and what I need to do to get better as a player. 'Everyone's dream growing up is seeing themselves in an away kit somewhere in a sunny country. But, in reality, I'm happy to be playing for Liverpool and trying to win trophies.' 'If, at that point in time [last season], I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away, probably for far less money than being said now.

3578,6b1e87f66400653762abe6de863b7874318a8cbd,"Thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination, claim researchers. It is hoped the new approach will target cancer stem cells that evade conventional drugs and cause the tumour to re-grow. Cancer that has spread and is incurable, known as secondary breast cancer, kills 1,000 women in Britain every month. Researchers from Manchester University working with drug development company Evgen Pharma, have developed a new combination of drugs which could overcome this problem. Thousands of women whose breast cancer has become resistant to standard treatment could benefit from a new drug combination. It targets cancer cells that evade conventional drugs and cause tumours to re-grow . They are testing the drug Sulforadex in the most common type of breast cancer, affecting 70 per cent of patients. These ‘oestrogen receptor’ (ER) cancers are currently tackled using hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen  to reduce oestrogen levels or block ER function. However, many women go on to develop resistance and the disease comes back, often because cancer stem cells which cause tumours to regrow and spread are unaffected by these treatments. The combination therapy, tested in mice and samples of tissue from secondary breast cancer patients, combines Sulforadex with standard hormonal treatments. Eating dinner or a snack late at night could raise a woman's risk of breast cancer, a study has warned. Researchers found eating meals at set times and eating dinner early reduced the risk. Leaving a longer time between the last meal or snack of the day and breakfast lowers the chance of developing the disease, US researchers found. They discovered women who fasted for longer overnight had significantly better control over their blood sugar levels. Each three hour increase in night-time fasting was associated with a four per cent lower glucose levels when tested after a meal, regardless of how much women ate, they found. Previous research has found women with higher blood sugar levels are more likely to develop cancer, even if they don't have diabetes. In the study, women reported eating five times per day and fasted overnight an average of 12 hours. Those who reported fasting for longer also indicated they consumed fewer calories per day, ate fewer calories after 10 pm and had fewer periods of eating. This targets both the oestrogen-sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells at the same time, says research presented at the American Association of Cancer Research annual conference today. Dr Robert Clarke, from the University’s Institute of Cancer Sciences, said: ‘The hormonal therapies we use today are very good at treating breast cancer tumours driven by oestrogen. ‘However, they don’t completely solve the problem. 'This combination of drugs potentially allows us to target oestrogen-sensitive cells, while also mopping up the cells which cause treatment resistance.’ The next step will be to recruit patients for a trial in the next few months. Dr David Howat, head of research and development at Evgen Pharma said: ‘We are really excited about the data presented at the AACR. 'Dr Rob Clarke and his research team have demonstrated the efficacy of Sulforadex. ‘We now intend to extend this collaboration and advance Sulforadex into a clinical trial with breast cancer patients.’ Katie Goates, at Breakthrough Breast Cancer and Breast Cancer Campaign, said: ‘While it’s important to remember that at this stage research has only been carried out in mice, this new combination of drugs shows exciting potential to overcome resistance to hormone treatments, such as tamoxifen. ‘Combining tamoxifen with Sulforadex resulted in fewer breast cancer stem cells surviving treatment compared to tamoxifen alone, lowering the likelihood of breast cancer returning or spreading to other parts of the body. ‘Oestrogen receptor’ cancers are currently tackled using hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen to reduce oestrogen levels or block ER function. The new therapy targets both the oestrogen-sensitive cells and the remaining cancer stem cells (pictured) at the same time . ‘Interestingly, Dr Clarke’s team has also shown that this combination of drugs reduces the number of cancer stem cells in secondary breast cancer samples. ‘This means that the combination also has the potential to extend how long tamoxifen treatment can work for women with secondary breast cancer (cancer that has spread), the incurable form of the disease. ‘Secondary breast cancer still kills 1,000 women in the UK every month so research that helps us to discover improved treatment options for women living with this form of breast cancer, or to help prevent cancer spreading, are vitally important. ‘We hope that planned clinical trials will follow quickly to tell us whether using tamoxifen with Sulforadex is safe and can deliver similar results in humans.’","New approach targets cancer stem cells that evade conventional treatment .

Zabaleta admits confidence is low with Sunday's derby loss at Manchester United having continued a dismal run which has seen City capitulate in the Barclays Premier League title race. Manuel Pellegrini's men crashed 4-2 at Old Trafford, a sixth defeat in eight games in all competitions and a result which leaves them fourth and clinging onto a Champions League place. Wayne Rooney leaps onto Fellaini's back after United take the lead through the big Belgian, who has had an excellent renaissance recently . It is a far cry from the situation on New Year's Day, when the defending champions pulled level with Chelsea at the top with a 3-2 win over Sunderland. Having been eight points behind just over a month earlier, City appeared to be clicking into gear - but all has suddenly gone wrong. They now trail the leaders by 12 points, having played a game more, and their form continues to offer encouragement for the likes of Southampton and Liverpool below them. A dejected Yaya Toure and Fernandinho look on following their defeat to rivals Manchester United . Zabaleta said: 'It is time to analyse what we are doing wrong and try to improve for the next few games. There are still 18 points to play for and we must be honest with ourselves and start to push hard, play better and win games, so we can get in the top four. 'When you lose those games it is always really hard, but that is football sometimes. Football is about momentum. 'It seems you lose confidence when you cannot get results and it was a really tough afternoon.' City were chasing a record fifth successive derby win and the occasion initially seemed to rouse them from their recent troubles as they made a blistering start. Sergio Aguero was the rare highlight in an otherwise dismal Manchester City performance at Old Trafford . Aguero scored twice, but he had very little to cheer about as Manchester City left the Eitihad empty handed . Their movement and energy was superb and they claimed a well-worked opening goal through Sergio Aguero after just eight minutes. But that was as good as it got as United equalised through the excellent Ashley Young and then took complete control. Further goals from the impressive Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata and Chris Smalling secured a convincing win before Aguero's 100th City goal came as a late consolation. 'It seems we lost confidence and were nervous,' said Zabaleta. 'Then it was hard for the team to react and we conceded the second goal. Manchester City's manager Manuel Pellegrini issues instructions as his side lose to their rivals . All of United's outfield players congratulate celebrate as they score in the derby at Old Trafford on Sunday . 'In the second half we didn't create many chances and when United scored the third goal the game was over.' Winger Jesus Navas was at a loss to explain City's failure to impose themselves after United pulled back level. The Spaniard said: 'I don't really know (what happened). They scored the equaliser and they were back in the game. We started strong but it wasn't our day and we need to focus on the upcoming games. It's Champions League (qualification at stake) so we have to fight until the end to be in the top four.'

She was 75. ""Cynthia Lennon passed away today at her home in Mallorca, Spain, following a short but brave battle with cancer.  Her son Julian Lennon was at her bedside throughout,"" his website says.  ""The family are thankful for your prayers. Please respect their privacy at this difficult time."" John and Cynthia Lennon were married for six years, from 1962 to 1968. The pair met at art school, where Cynthia studied to be an illustrator and John practiced painting -- in between concerts with a band that would become the Beatles. ""When we were at art college, I think he was more interested in the music than he was in the art,"" she told ClassicBands.com. Cynthia Lennon, born Cynthia Powell in 1939, was a stabilizing force for the young John, who lost his mother when he was a teenager and was raised by his Aunt Mimi. ""John was always insecure,"" she said in a 2005 interview, having lost his mother at a young age. But his humor -- and his wildness -- were attractive, she told ClassicBands.com. ""He was a rebel. He was outrageous. That was something I hadn't experienced before the age that I was, which was about 16 or 17. I'd had quite a normal, straightforward life,"" she said. ""I was just instantly attracted to him."" The two married in 1962, just as the Beatles were making their rise. Their son, Julian, was born April 8, 1963. Lennon's sometimes-brittle personality and his overwhelming fame became a challenge for Cynthia. During her pregnancy, ""I was not supposed to be known or heard about. In the wisdom, or lack of wisdom, anything to do with somebody becoming famous, male, was not supposed to be married or have (a) girlfriend."" She was threatened by fans and occasionally in danger of being left behind in the band's whirlwind; when the group traveled to Bangor, Wales, to meet with the Maharishi in 1967, Cynthia was caught in a scrum and couldn't make the train in time. She was also there on the 1965 night George Harrison, Patti Boyd and Lennon were dosed with LSD -- an experience she disliked -- and traveled to India with the band in early 1968. The couple divorced in 1968, by which time John was seeing Yoko Ono. Cynthia Lennon married three more times after John and wrote two books about her marriage to the Beatle, ""A Twist of Lennon"" and ""John."" She had no contact with the surviving members of the band until meeting up at the 2006 Las Vegas premiere of ""The Beatles Love."" For all the difficulties and disappointments -- she described Julian, for whom she wrote ""John,"" as ""very scarred by life"" -- she acknowledged that the whirlwind could also be enthralling. ""The whole situation changed my life completely. God knows where I would've been ended up. I probably would've been a schoolteacher with about three or four children in a boring situation,"" she told ClassicBands.com. ""I've had the most amazing life, a wonderful life.""

The blunder was believed to have been caused by a race marshal taking a toilet break during the event, missing 300 runners who should have been directed at a junction point. Instead they continued past the unmanned marshall point and had to run for an extra three kilometres while the other 900 competitors followed the correct route. Scroll down for video . Blunder: Charity runners taking part in yesterday's Bournemouth Bay 10K Run (pictured) were left exhausted after being sent on an unscheduled two-mile detour . The bizarre gaffe happened during yesterday's Bournemouth Bay Run and today the organisers - Bournemouth Borough Council - appealed for those who were affected by the mix-up to contact them for a 'gesture of goodwill.' A local authority spokesman said that it was investigating what happened to the marshal who should have directed runners at a turning point. It was reported that some runners were 'in tears' while one described the event's organisation as 'shambolic'. Hayley James, who is four months pregnant and from Poole, said: 'To have a race of that scale with only one marshal on a point is inexcusable. 'We saw loads of people walking at the end, some were in tears, I felt so sorry for them - I felt like crying at the 10km mark.' Andy Isaac, from Bournemouth, said the event was 'mayhem' with one point where an elderly woman managed to drive onto the route and was flashing her lights at oncoming runners. A map shows where up to 300 runners continued along the coastal path after a marshal who was meant to direct them on to a turn went to the toilet . Reaction: Two people vent their frustration at the Bournemouth Bay Run on Twitter yesterday . It also emerged that water stations ran out of supplies during the race, forcing some runners to drink from half-empty bottles that had been left on the ground as they battled against dehydration. Commenting on the Daily Echo website, one runner said: “We had a bottle of water at the three mile station, but at the six mile point they had totally ran out, so nothing. Jon Weaver, head of resort marketing and events at the council, said: 'Unfortunately there was some confusion with marshalling arrangements at one point, but it was a critical point. We apologise unreservedly to those front runners. 'In 33 years of running... this is the first time this has happened and as part of our debrief we will be analysing the arrangements carefully... to learn for 2016. 'We understand runners have trained for a long time for the event and it's hard for them and we do empathise with how they are feeling.' It was hoped that the event would have raised more than £70,000 for the British Heart Foundation. Some racers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the blunder. Rob Kelly wrote: Really disappointed in the #BournemouthBayRun 10k that ended up 13k very poor show bad marshalling #wontbeback.'

The intention is to build a single new structure in their place, with more than 5,500 seats, in the south-western corner of the home of cricket - to raise the ground's overall capacity to almost 30,000. MCC is operating to a projected budget of £80million, and hopes work can begin in autumn 2017 - subject to planning permission, consultation with nearby residents and the approval of club members. MCC reveals plans to replace the 'tired' Tavern and Allen stands at Lord's, with completion scheduled for 2019 . The redevelopment will increase the overall capacity of Lord's, the home of English cricket, to almost 30,000 . If the project goes ahead, a new Thomas Lord Building and new Tavern pub will also be included - as well as enlarged dressing rooms in the pavilion and a 'more pedestrian-friendly entrance to the ground', via the Grace Gates. MCC chief executive Derek Brewer said: 'The south-western project will ensure facilities for players, match officials, supporters and MCC members are of the highest possible standard by modernising areas of the ground that have become tired. 'MCC is committed to maintaining Lord's as the finest cricket ground in the world, and this project also provides a wonderful new front door to the home of cricket.' MCC aims to submit a planning application to Westminster City Council this summer. A completion schedule for the new stand is spring 2019, in time for that summer's World Cup and Ashes. It is anticipated the remaining elements of the 'Masterplan' may take a further three years.

908,58ca33afaedb09b79686b806d737e6709dd147c0,"Nicola Sturgeon this afternoon scoffed at claims by Labour leader Ed Miliband that he would never do a deal with the SNP to become Prime Minister - insisting he will 'change his tune' after the election. The Scottish First Minister said Mr Miliband simply 'won't have the votes to say that he is going to do what he likes come what may' and reiterated her call for Labour to 'work together to lock the Tories out'. It came after Mr Miliband this morning repeatedly insisted he would not enter into any deal with the SNP after the election - either as a formal Coalition or a looser pact to put him in Number 10. Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine meet Hindu devotees at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple in Willesden Green, London today . The Labour leader's visit to the north London temple came after he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show he would not do any deals with the SNP . But Ms Sturgeon said 'I suspect Ed Miliband will change his tune once the votes are cast..' Labour is expected to suffer heavy losses in Scotland - where it won 41 seats in 2010 - with forecasts suggesting Ms Sturgeon's party could see as many as 50 MPs elected. The latest set of UK-wide polls indicate that the General Election race is still neck-and-neck, with the country heading for a probable hung parliament and coalition negotiations after May 7. Pressed on whether he would consider a confidence-and-supply deal with the SNP to ensure backing for a Queen's Speech and Budget if he failed to secure an overall majority, Mr Miliband said: 'I am not interested in deals, no.' The Labour leader told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'If it is a Labour government it will be a Labour Queen's Speech, it will be a Labour Budget. It will not be written by the SNP.' But Ms Sturgeon told Sky News: 'On May 8 once the votes are cast, once the people have cast their verdict, Ed Miliband, just like the rest of us, will have to respect the wishes of the people in a democratic election. Nicola Sturgeon, the leader of the Scottish National Party, visits Jump Gymnastics community club in Cumbernauld during a campaign event, Scotland . Ms Sturgeon launched the SNP's youth manifesto today as polls predicted the party would win a landslide victory on May 7 . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon speaking at a rally of female activists to launch the SNP's women's pledge today . 'If there is a minority government, if no party has an overall majority, then it's simply not possible to ignore the views of other parties - I know that, I was part of a minority government at the Scottish Parliament. 'So if the SNP has a large number of MPs, firstly we can use that clout to keep the Tories out, and secondly we can use it to ensure the Tories are replaced with something better, bolder and more progressive. 'If that remains the case on May 8 if he doesn't have a majority, what he will be saying to the people is rather than work with the SNP if there is an anti-Tory majority, he'd rather watch David Cameron waltz back into Downing Street. 'I don't want that and the SNP will use our votes to stop a Tory government getting off the ground if there is that anti-Tory majority.' Ms Sturgeon added: 'It's the people who are in charge and the politicians have to respect the democratic wishes of the people, if Ed Miliband doesn't get a majority, as the polls are all saying he won't, then he'll have to work with other parties.' David Cameron delivers a speech to party activists while campaigning in Norton Sub Hamdon near Yeovil today . Mr Cameron said he made 'no apology' for focussing on the threat posed by the SNP in the election next month . The latest opinion poll in Scotland shows Labour remains on course for heavy losses to the Scottish nationalists in its heartlands north of the border - keeping hold of as few as five seats. Just over a quarter  of Scots say they will be voting for Labour in the election, according to the Panelbase poll for The Sunday Times, down two on earlier in the month, with the SNP up three points to stand at 48 per cent. With the election now less than two weeks away, the Prime Minister and other leading Tories have stepped up their attacks on the SNP. David Cameron warned voters that they have '11 days to save Britain' as he claimed Scottish nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed'. In an escalation of his rhetoric about the dangers of the May 7 General Election producing a minority Labour government propped up by the Scottish National Party, he told the Sunday Express that nationalist MPs would be hoping for a 'disaster' which would bring forward their dream of independence. Meanwhile, Conservative Home Secretary Theresa May told the Mail on Sunday that a Labour/SNP government could be 'the biggest constitutional crisis since the abdication', when King Edward VIII gave up the throne in 1936. Ms Sturgeon said: 'Theresa May has made herself look completely and utterly stupid with ridiculous over the top comments like that. 'This is the same Theresa May that tried to tell the people of Scotland during the referendum campaign that if we voted Yes we would lose our passports and have border controls. 'People will look at these silly comments, and I was going to say they will treat them with contempt, but that actually attaches too much seriousness to them. People will just laugh at her.'","Scottish First Minister said Mr Miliband simply 'won't have the votes'

8495,0db1a9abd0524d51270531e3a80d36afaa7550fe,"A former Democratic congressional aide who pleaded guilty last year to raping two women was spared jail time on Friday because horrific disfiguring injuries he suffered in an unrelated 2013 acid attack. Donny Ray Williams, who was once a staffer for the Senate Homeland Security subcommittee, slipped an intern Ambien in 2010 before having sex with her while she lay unconscious. That same year, he had sex with a woman too inebriated to give her consent, prosecutors say. Despite admitting his guilt in December, D.C. prosecutors on Friday asked that Williams be spared prison time because he is himself the victim of a crime - the effects of which will mar the remainder of his life, Washington Post reports. No jail time: Former Capitol Hill staffer Donny Ray Williams is disfigured from an acid attack that occurred years after he raped two women. A judge on Friday agreed with a prosecutor's recommendation that he not serve jail time due to his serious injuries, for which he's undergone 20 surgeries and still faces more life threatening operations . The decision to give Williams a suspended jail sentence and 5 years probation - which Judge Robert E. Morin reluctantly agreed to - came despite one of his victim's request he be given 'some jail time.' 'He gave me a random dose of drugs and risked my life,' the woman argued in a letter read in D.C. Superior Court last week. The woman had just moved to Washington as an intern. She initially warmed to Williams because she believed he could help her get a leg up on Capitol Hill. 'After the assault, I moved away, and he continued to harass me and threatened me to drop the charges. This crime has caused me fear, pain and a financial burden,' she wrote. The other woman Williams raped was not present for the sentencing, during which Judge Morin said Williams 'was a victim of an independent crime and has serious medical issues.' Williams' own attack occurred in 2013 as he walked down a Washington street. A man approached him and tossed acid in his face that dripped down his body, he told the Post. 'I thought I was going to die,' Williams recalled. Acid attack: Williams was approached by a man in 2013 on a Washington street who tossed acid on his face. He believes a former girlfriend's jealous ex was behind the attack. He's now blind in one eye and nearly blind in the other . Massive second and third-degree burns put him in the hospital for two months, blinded him in one eye and nearly blinded him in the other. Williams believes the jealous boyfriend of a woman he was dating was behind the assault, the Post reports. Much of his face is now gnarled and disfigured and he currently has a massive lump at the top of his skull where doctors have surgically implanted a rod that stretches his skin in order to promote healing. He's undergone some 20 surgeries and still faces more 'life threatening surgeries. 'How easy it is for men to use power to abuse,' Williams said in court. 'Rape is cowardly, shameful and downright evil. I promise, I will protect a woman's right to her own body.' He'd previously denied the allegations against him, saying he only pleaded guilty because he wanted to focus on his health and not a trial. He now says he's a $1 million in debt and jobless after spending years working with such notable politicians as Senator Mary Landrieu and Senator Herb Koh. He worked in the Obama administration as the general deputy assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental relations in the Department of Housing and Urban Development between April 2009 and October 2010. Williams had served as a staff director for the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee. He started working on Capitol Hill in 1999 for Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.).","Donny Ray Williams on Friday was given a suspended sentence and 5 years probation for two 2010 sexual assaults .

8025,ea88fe1fa50cc94fd6921c9f02cb952e380ee823,"With Saturday's fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao billed as the $300million fight of the century, it's no surprise that its pay-per-view figures look set to blow previous bouts out of the water. In the US, viewers are being charged between $89.99 (£59) and $99.99 (£66) to watch the fight while in Britain, Sky Box Office is offering the bout for £19.99, but those figures will equate to a small fraction of the earnings for Mayweather and Pacquiao. Once ticket sales and casino profits have been considered, the eagerly anticipated mega-fight, which is due to take place at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, will become the biggest pay-per-view in sport and could see the two fighters pocket astronomical sums. This Sports Interaction graphic shows how much Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao stand to earn . American boxing legend Mike Tyson features in four of the top 10 highest grossing pay-per-view fights . The eagerly-anticipated mega-fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao is just days away . Canadian data crunchers Sports Interaction have put together all the big numbers to find out who will earn what, the top 10 pay-per-view bouts by earnings and whether the  event will give fans value for money. Firstly, let's take a look at how much Mayweather and Pacquiao stand to earn should the showpiece fight go the distance on May 2. 12 rounds of jousting will give Mayweather a stunning $170m (£111m) purse, meaning the 38-year-old will be picking up $15m (£9m) per round and $5m (£3m) per minute. His opponent stands to earn slightly less and could bank almost $95m (£62m) which boils down to a tidy $8.4m (£5m) per round. Pacquiao gets in his last workout in Los Angeles before heading to Las Vegas on Monday . Mayweather has featured in three of the top 10 highest grossing pay-per-view fights to date . The average payout for the top 10 pay-per-view fighters stands at $22.4m (£14m) Mayweather tends to give his viewers values for money by going the distance during his fights . Six of the top 10 pay-per-view events have gone the distance, which is encouraging news for fans across the globe who will be paying to tune in. Although the Las Vegas mega-fight is set to eclipse the highest grossing bouts to date, there will still be one man that can claim to have featured in more of the top 10 duels than Mayweather. Mike Tyson featured in four of the top 10 grossing bouts, ahead of 'Money' Mayweather and Evander Holyfield who have both featured in three. Mayweather's lucrative victory against Saul Alvarez in 2013 looks set to be eclipsed by his next bout . The American poses for photos with singer Justin Bieber after defeating Alvarez in Las Vegas . Oscar De La Hoya has featured in two, while Lennox Lewis, Miguel Cotto, Saul Alvarez, Peter McNeeley, Shane Moseley, Felix Trinidad, George Foreman and Pacquiao have all featured in one. Tyson may have featured in more of the top fights, but it's Mayweather who is currently sitting pretty at the top of the pile after his pay-per-view 12-round fight against Alvarez in September, 2013 saw the American collect a total close to $140m (£91m). Pacquiao features only once in the current list after earning around $555,555 per minute for his victory against Shane Moseley in 2011. Mike Tyson's heavyweight bout against Lennox Lewis (right) in 2002, grossed $112m (£73m) Tyson looks on after being knocked down for a final time by Lewis after just eight rounds . Tyson's biggest earner came after his defeat against British legend Lennox Lewis as the pair claimed $760,869 (£497,796) per minute each after eight rounds. Tyson is also responsible for the first and second most economically inefficient fights inside our top 10. In 1997, his constant biting of Holyfield saw him disqualified at the end of the third round, resulting in that pay-per-view event costing fans $5.59 (£3.60) a minute for the action. Those still deciding whether whether to fork out for Saturday's fight may be swayed by the fact that each fight inside the top 10 grossing bouts that has involved Mayweather or Pacquiao has gone the distance. Tyson is also responsible for the second most economically inefficient fight for fans after being disqualified for biting Evander Holyfield in the third round during the WBA heavyweight clash in 1997 . Holyfield reacts after Tyson bit his ear during the third round of their heavyweight fight in Las Vegas .","Floyd Mayweather faces Manny Pacquiao in Las Vegas on May 2 .

6176,b0ea3f32de1d0729f7121e4ebd481ad2a41695a4,"The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to pick up their pets' droppings and use bins provided (pictured) A London council is to  introduce CSI-style DNA testing for dogs so it can track and fine owners who don't clean up after their animals. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham wants dog owners to submit a DNA sample from the inside of the animal's cheek so it is registered on a database. The council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets - and issue the owner an £80 fine. The laboratory testing is believed to be 99.9 per cent accurate. The council hopes that the collection of DNA samples would fit well with new national laws requiring all owners in Britain to microchip their dogs by April next year. And while it will mean an expense for the council, they believe it will represent value for money for residents as similar schemes in the US have reduced dog fouling by up to 90 per cent. The move is part of efforts from the council to reduce its £2.3million annual street cleansing bill. Although the methods may seem extreme, Council leader Councillor Darren Rodwell claims they are necessary to clean up the borough. He said: 'We are the first Council in the country to get really tough on dog mess and pet owners who do not act in a socially responsible way. 'The vast majority of dog owners in Barking and Dagenham are socially responsible but unfortunately a selfish few think it's ok to not clean up after their pet. 'Dog mess not only spoils our streets – it's also a health hazard and especially to young children which is why we are using this innovative approach.' The scheme is currently being discussed under the tagline Leading A New Way - but there are no plans as yet to make it mandatory. The London Borough of Barking and Dagenham, Civic Centre pictured, will become the first in the UK to introduce the plans which will allow them to match dog mess to owners and issue fines . They're currently in discussion with stakeholders including the Kennel Club, Keep Britain Tidy and Streetkleen, the company which will run the DNA testing, on how owners can be encouraged to submit the samples. Streetkleen managing director Gary Downie said: 'I believe the combination of DNA testing and enforcement could be the most effective means of ensuring owners are held accountable for their dog's actions. 'In the US, we have experienced reductions in dog fouling by as much as 90 per cent after introducing the programme. 'For the vast majority of responsible dog owners this should pose no problem at all. 'In fact, we believe that the minimal cost involved in the DNA testing will pose value for money when the selfish minority of dog owners are brought to task.'","Barking and Dagenham to become first council to DNA test dog mess .

11107,731eff1567a079ec97e350c63527ef027de44d0e,"Two sons of an ailing bestselling true crime writer are accused of defrauding and bullying her into giving them more than $125,000 - despite the pair already receiving a monthly allowance of $25,000 combined with their two sisters through their mother's corporation. Ann Rule's son, 54-year-old Andrew Rule, is accused of bullying her into giving him $23,327, according to court documents, and admitted to authorities that he blew the money given to him on gambling and strip clubs. Michael Rule, 51, who receives approximately $9,000 a month between salaries paid to him and his wife by Rule Enterprises, LLC, is accused of forging his mother's signature on her checks from March 2014 to February 2015 amounting to $103,628. Prosecutors have filed a restraining order against both men to stay away from Ann Rule, and the two sons accused of wrongdoing are set to appear in court on April 30. Famous true crime writer Ann Rule (above), 84, had more than $100,000 allegedly stolen and defrauded from her by her two sons . Ann Rule, 84, is known for many of her crime books, notably the 1980 bestseller The Stranger Beside Me based on serial killer Ted Bundy. She has published 33 books and eight of those have been turned into movies including Ann Rule Presents: The Stranger Beside Me and Small Sacrifices. The Washington-based author has been in declining health since 2013 after she broke her hip, she also suffers from periods of extreme confusion and is vulnerable to undue influence, according to the Huffington Post. Court documents also said she is 'largely confined to a wheelchair', is unable to 'perform many activities of daily living without assistance' and 'she is on oxygen at all times'. Her son-in-law, Glen Scorr, alerted authorities in March after he became suspicious that she was being 'financially exploited' by her two sons. An investigation revealed that Michael and Andrew Rule along with their two siblings, Leslie and Laura, receive an estimated $25,000 monthly salary combined through their mother's corporation Rule Enterprises LLC for work they perform on her behalf, according to court documents. The four children also have their health and dental insurance covered through the corporation. Andrew Rule, who also has his rent and car insurance covered by his mother, would allegedly bully her until she would give in and write him a check, according to court documents. 'Andy would pester and bully Ann relentlessly for money, sometimes threatening suicide, sometimes trying to make her feel guilty, sometimes screaming obscenities at her, until she would finally give in and write him a check,' the documents stated. Authorities said he would have an excuse for needing money which included when he got injured and needed money for medical expenses, repairing his car, groceries, buying a racehorse and needing clothes after getting a new job. Andrew Rule (pictured above), the son of  author Ann Rule, has been charged with theft by deception in a case of alleged financial exploitation of his mother's money. His brother, Michael Rule, has been charged with theft and forgery . A protection order was granted against Andrew Rule on February 3 prohibiting him from having any contact with Ann Rule except for under limited circumstances, according to court documents. However, authorities said he violated it and was arrested on March 27. While in custody, he told officers he battled with gambling and drug addictions for years, and that he used the money given to him by his mother on gambling and strip clubs. He also told officers he pressured his mother for money never intending to use it for the stated purposes, according to court documents. 'I have never in my life, as God as my witness, stolen anything whatsoever from my mom,' Andrew Rule told KIRO-TV. 'Basically I used to have a gambling problem but I don't anymore and I have absolutely no idea why I was pulled in at the same time my brother was,' he continued. He has been charged with first-degree theft. Michael Rule, who reportedly receives a higher salary than his siblings because he is more involved in his mother's day-to-day care, is accused of forging her signature on her checks, according to court documents. Prosecutors have filed a restraining order against both men to stay away from Ann Rule, and the two sons accused of wrongdoing are set to appear in court on April 30. Ann Rule is known for many of her crime books including The Stranger Beside Me based on serial killer Ted Bundy .

She also confirmed the checks written with her signature was not hers and that it appears to be the signature of Michael Rule, according to documents.

'He became increasingly insistent he needed the money to pay his mortgage and other expenses. He would yell at his mother demanding money as she cowered in her wheelchair,' the documents stated. Ann Rule told authorities in an interview that Michael Rule would fly into rages throwing things across the room and sweeping a counter clean with his arm. A family friend, John Patrick Kelly, who was hired as a handyman by Ann Rule stated he had previously been physically assaulted by Michael Rule, according to court documents. Michael Rule has been charged with first-degree theft and forgery, and both men are out of jail on personal recognizance, according to KIRO-TV.

Root reached the milestone aged 24 years, 115 days. Cook was 401 days quicker. However, Root did get there in fewer innings than India great Sachin Tendulkar. Joe Root's 182 not out took him past 2,000 runs in Tests, the second fastest Englishman to the milestone . Dad Stokes joins fun . Thursday's play finished with Marlon Samuels’ comedy salute to England’s Ben Stokes after the batsman was dismissed following days of needling between the pair. Cue outrage from some, indifference from others and a sprinkling of laughter thrown in. Stokes’s dad, Gerard, saw the funny side, tweeting: ‘Great send off Marlon Samuels. Live by the sword die by the sword, great stuff son.’ Marlon Samuels gave Ben Stokes a salute send off after dismissing the England all-rounder . Broad can't believe it . Stuart Broad continues to search for a run in this Test series and even a desperate appeal on Friday couldn’t help his cause. He tried to sweep Devendra Bishoo but only gloved it to give slip Devon Smith a simple catch. A pointless review. ‘I think that goes up to Broad’s No 1 worst-ever review,’ said Jonathan Agnew on BBC’s Test Match Special.

You have to go back 113 years to find the last time England had three players run out in the first innings of a Test — in January 1902 against Australia in Adelaide. England are one short of the record of four run-outs in one innings though, which is shared by India and Australia — set in 1955 and 1969 respectively.

England coaches Peter Moores and Paul Farbrace plan to fly straight from Barbados to Dublin after the third Test to make sure they are in charge for the first one-day international since the disastrous World Cup. The pair were expected to miss the match as it comes, oddly, just three days after the scheduled finish of this Test series on May 5. But so keen are they to be present for the start of the new one-day era, the England pair will fly from Barbados to Heathrow on May 6, then straight on to Dublin to take practice on May 7.

The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn’t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn’t that much more, but when you’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'","The actress, 29, says she had to pay out of pocket for her 2007 abortion because she couldn't tell her mother .

4271,3c53e7d227b2a1b72679806ceb7ca663c2d2ad55,"(CNN)A jury of Rolling Stone's media peers has dissected the magazine's disastrous, discredited story about rape on the campus of the University of Virginia, and the emerging consensus is that Rolling Stone's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough, devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. Rolling Stone's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable. The magazine's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not. Before the original story, ""A Rape on Campus,"" was pulled from the Rolling Stone website, it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in November -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine's history. An anonymous undergraduate, given the name ""Jackie,"" told Rolling Stone writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang-raped by seven boys, who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student, a casual acquaintance, who had invited Jackie to the party. The horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity,  a police investigation, the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses. But the story began to unravel almost immediately when Washington Post reporter T. Rees Shapiro took a closer look, leading Rolling Stone to back away from the story and request a review by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. That review, which is considerably longer than the original article, reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice. Rolling Stone writer Erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations; she never spoke to three of Jackie's friends who allegedly talked with Jackie immediately after the attack, and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond, refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when. And at every step of the way, when Jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither Erdely nor her editors or the magazine's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story. Having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade (including one semester at Columbia), I would agree with colleagues who call Rolling Stone's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom. I've told students for years: You should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond. And you should never take a source's word about important facts without verifying the truth. (There's a reason we call it reporting and not dictation.) Most of all, I tell students, remember that you're writing about human beings, who are complicated creatures: The good guys are never all that good, and the bad guys usually aren't completely bad. People can be mistaken or deceitful, I tell young reporters, they frequently forget and often lie to themselves. That doesn't make a source useless, but it must make you extra careful. Unfortunately, the early word from Rolling Stone is that they've absorbed none of these lessons. Publisher Jann Wenner has apparently decided not to fire, demote or discipline anybody at Rolling Stone, provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists. ""No one fired at Rolling Stone. Really?"" wrote CNN media critic Brian Stelter. ""What would Rolling Stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably, damaged people's lives, but punished no one?"" tweeted John Bresnahan, the Capitol bureau chief of Politico. ""Rolling Stone outsources its investigation to Columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward? OK...,"" tweeted pundit Joe Concha. Worse still, the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle, framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim. ""Rolling Stone's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems,"" the Columbia report says. And check out this amazing conclusion from Will Dana, the managing editor who presided over the disaster. Dana told the Columbia team: ""It's not like I think we need to overhaul our process, and I don't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things. We just have to do what we've always done and just make sure we don't make this mistake again."" That smug attitude pretty much ensures Rolling Stone's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future. At a minimum, they should heed the wise counsel of my friend Bill Grueskin, an executive editor at Bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the Columbia J-school. ""When doing big, investigative stories, reporters face many challenges: recalcitrant sources, complex numbers, buried records. Editors, whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity, are spared most of those hurdles. But they face their own internal newsroom challenges, particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story,"" Grueskin writes. ""They must keep their star reporters happy, trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative, and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic."" The problem could be, says Grueskin, that Rolling Stone had too many chefs in the kitchen, instead of ""a single, talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae."" Until Wenner and his team learn that basic lesson -- and revamp their hiring, editing and fact-checking process accordingly -- the Rolling Stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another, one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming.","Columbia journalism school team finds major lapses in Rolling Stone's University of Virginia rape story .

The Bees controlled the game for long periods after going ahead through Alex Pritchard's brilliant strike - but missed chances in the second half came back to haunt them when Bent grabbed his 10th goal for the Rams. Derby went into the game knowing they needed to win to keep their slim hopes of automatic promotion alive and Tom Ince twice went close in the opening seven minutes. Alex Pritchard celebrates his stunning strike with his Brentford team-mates, after putting his side ahead . Derby: Grant, Keogh, Albentosa, Forsyth, Warnock (Whitbread 78 mins), Russell (Dawkins 46), Bryson (Lingard 78), Hendrick, Ince, Bent, Martin . Subs not used: Ward, Roos, Hanson, Thomas .

Goal: Pritchard 21 . Booked: Tarkowski . Referee: Graham Scott . The on-loan Hull winger was caught by Toumani Diagouraga in the fifth minute and curled the 25-yard free-kick over the wall and just past David Button's left post with the goalkeeper desperately scrambling to get across. Button had to plunge to his right two minutes later when Ince curled a shot from the edge of the box but Brentford hit back in the 14th minute when Jota's header set up Moses Odubajo for a shot that Lee Grant pushed away. Grant was relieved to see a free-kick from Alan Judge whistle past his left post after Pritchard was tripped by Raul Albentosa just outside the area in the 22nd minute - but he was beaten by a quality goal six minutes later. Diagouraga tackled Jeff Hendrick deep in his own half and found Jonathan Douglas who quickly released Judge, before Pritchard went past Richard Keogh and Craig Bryson and bent a right foot shot from the edge of the box past the despairing dive of Grant. Pritchard again found space just outside the area but this time he shot straight at Grant before Ince ran down the left of Brentford's defence to drive in a low shot which Button saved diving to his left. Alan Judge strikes a free kick over the Derby wall, but it flies just over the crossbar . Brentford were good value for their half-time lead and they came close to increasing it in the 51st minute when Bryson's attempted clearance spun back to Andre Gray - but Albentosa deflected his shot wide. Gray had another chance four minutes later when Douglas played him in but fired wide from eight yards, then the home fans found their voice when sub Simon Dawkins played Bent in but Button raced off his line to make the save. There was a big let-off for Derby in the 68th minute when Jota pulled the ball back from the edge of the six-yard box to tee up Douglas - but his shot was cleared off the line by Craig Forsyth. Brentford had another chance in the 73rd minute when Stuart Dallas crossed to the back post, where Gray headed over at full stretch and the Rams nearly made them pay when Zak Whitbread flicked on a corner and Button made an instinctive save to push the ball behind. But Derby grabbed a goal they barely deserved in the second minute of stoppage time when Hendrick fired in a low shot and Bent pounced to stab home an equaliser that was tough on Brentford.

Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff is confident the matter has been laid to rest after Rosberg bemoaned Hamilton's 'selfish' tactics following their one-two finish at the Shanghai International Circuit. Hamilton was absolved of any blame by both Wolff and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, although the problem did at least provide another scenario from which to learn. Lewis Hamilton celebrates on the podium after winning the Chinese Grand Prix on Sunday . Hamilton led home Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg in Shanghai to retain his lead in the championship . With the next race in Bahrain following up swiftly on Sunday, Wolff said: 'We saw tensions between Nico and Lewis in the race and we tackled them directly on Sunday night to stop anything carrying over to this weekend. 'When you have intense competition it's normal it causes emotions to run high - and that's not something we want to change. 'Both drivers are now very focused on delivering maximum performance in Bahrain and our package should cope well with the demands of the circuit. 'We maintain our philosophy of letting the drivers race, but they both know the No 1 priority for the team is to win for Mercedes-Benz.' For Rosberg, in particular, the race offers an opportunity for swift retribution as the 29-year-old has so far been trounced this season by Hamilton, who has finished ahead on the grid after qualifying and in all three races to date. Hamilton, who has out-qualified and finished ahead of Rosberg at every race, sprays a grid girl with champagne . 'China was a frustrating weekend for me and I'm glad we have another race right away to get straight back to work,' said Rosberg. 'The team has made a great start to the season, and with this incredible car they have built I know I just need to find a little bit more in myself to get back to the top step. 'I've never won in Bahrain but I've taken the last two pole positions here and also set the fastest lap at this circuit on my Formula One debut, so I know I have the pace.' Rosberg accused Hamilton of being 'selfish' as tension rose between the two Mercedes team-mates in China . Last year's intense battle between Hamilton and Rosberg was one of the highlights of the season, and lit the blue touchpaper to their rivalry as it was later discovered the latter attacked Hamilton by using a different engine setting. Rosberg is now eager to finally get one over on Hamilton, adding: ""Of course, everyone remembers the race last year and it would be great for the fans if we can put on another great show for them this time. 'If we can do that, but with the two top steps in a different order, it would be fantastic. 'It won't be so easy with the competition (in Ferrari) breathing down our necks. 'But that makes for even more exciting racing, so I'm looking forward to a great battle and I'm determined to come out on top.'","Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg to renew F1 title rivalry at Bahrain GP .

The grandmother of brain cancer victim Ashya King has criticised police for spending more than £16,000 on the search for him. Hampshire police launched the hunt after the five-year-old, pictured, was taken from Southampton General Hospital by his parents last August so he could be treated abroad. The couple were found in Spain but released without charge. A Freedom of Information request revealed staff and officers claimed £12,712.97 in overtime over six days. A further £1406 was spent on accommodation, £792 on flights, £132 on travel and parking, £213 on food and subsistence and £900 on hiring experts to report to the CPS. Patricia King, 77, said: 'It's disgusting to spend all that money when there's crime going on. It's just a joke. 'It was absolutely disgraceful chasing my son and putting him in prison.' Medics claimed the Kings had put Ashya's life at risk by fleeing the country with him. However after their released he was flown to a hospital in the Czech Republic to undergo proton beam therapy and is now on the road to recovery.

The midfielder scored a spectacular strike as former Palace boss Tony Pulis enjoyed a 2-0 win on his first return to Selhurst Park. The Welshman left Palace on the eve of the new season and has since taken over at the Hawthorns - with three points in south London crucial having seen his side lose their last three in the Premier League. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side . But Gardner, whose trademark second-half goal added to James Morrison's early header, knows the job is still not yet complete even if West Brom now sit eight points clear of the bottom three. 'Yes, it's massive,' he said when asked about the importance of the victory. 'The gaffer has given us the target of 40 points and we will be disappointed if we don't hit that. 'We had two or three bad results on the spin and it's nice to get a win over the line after those. We were expecting what they brought with us and we dealt really well with it.' Gardner revealed the set-piece which led to Morrison heading home in the second minute came straight from the training ground as he now looks to add to his own tally for the season. 'It was a start that we worked on all week in training and it has worked perfectly,' he added. Gardner lets fly with this long range strike, which ended up doubling West Brom's lead at the Selhurst Park . Before two minutes on the clock, James Morrison (right) headed West Brom ahead following a corner . On the goal he scored, Gardner added: 'It was nice to catch one like that, over the years I've caught a couple of sweet ones and I usually get a couple in a season so I'm waiting for another one now.' For Palace, their fine run of form may have come to an abrupt end but Scott Dann, who was signed by Pulis in January 2014, insists the squad will dust themselves down and look to go again at home to relegation-threatened Hull next weekend. 'We've been on a great run,' he told Palace's official website. West Brom captain Darren Fletcher (right) celebrates with goalscorer James Morrison at Crystal Palace .

Michael Hanline, 69, was convicted of murder for the fatal shooting of truck driver JT McGarry in 1980, and on Wednesday a judge dismissed the charges against him. In a video posted on April 20 by the California Innocence Project, which has been working to free Hanline since 1999, he is seen on the day he was released at the counter of a Carl's Jr asking for a hamburger 'they show on TV with the bacon on it'. As he dug into his meal of a large  Mile High Bacon Cheeseburger with fries and a drink, it was a special moment for him. 'My oh my, that's what meat tastes like huh?' he said after taking his first bite. 'The commercial does it justice.' Scroll down for video . Michael Hanline, 69, who was wrongfully imprisoned for 36 years, was dismissed of charges on Wednesday. On the day of his release last November, the moment he ate his first burger after being in prison for decades was captured on video (above Hanline tucking away into a bacon cheeseurger at a Carl's Jr restaurant) On Wednesday, after a GPS monitor was cut off, Hanline finally  put on the boots (above) he last wore 36 years ago when he went to prison for a crime he did not commit . Following more than three decades after Hanline was incarcerated, it emerged that crucial DNA analysis and investigative reports were withheld from his original trial. The new evidence proved that Hanline was innocent and the longest-serving wrongfully imprisoned inmate in California's history was finally released last November. And earlier this week, a judge dismissed him of the charges. 'The whole thing was surreal for him when we got him out. It’s impossible for any of us to imagine what it’s like to spend 36 years in prison and then come out,' Justin Brooks, director of California Innocence Project at California Western School of Law told Daily Mail Online. In the video showing his first moments of freedom, Hanline is seen on November 24, 2014 walking with  Brooks as he takes his first steps after leaving prison. 'Today is the day we are finally getting the first of the California 12 out of prison,' Brooks says in the video. In the video posted on April 20 by California Innocence Project, Hanline is seen on the day of his release on November 24, 2014 as he walks out to a cheering crowd . Holding his wife Sandy's hand, the video shows him looking up into the sky and taking in a breath of fresh air as he leaves prison. While in the car he said: 'It's just an incredible rush. It doesn't seem I guess actually real yet' Hanline is then greeted by a cheering crowd as he walks next to Brooks, and holding his wife's hand, he walks out of the doors looking up at the sky. When asked what he is feeling in that moment, he is left speechless only able to shake his head in awe. 'You can see the look on his face when he looks up at the sky as a free man and it’s so overwhelming for him,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. 'My oh my oh my. It's kind of hard. This feels like I'm on the front of a rocket ship,' Hanline says in the video as he rides in the backseat of a car. 'It's just an incredible rush. It doesn't seem I guess actually real yet.' Brooks said Hanline had not seen much movement in 36 years so everything just seemed like it was moving at a 1,000 miles per hour while he was inside the car. 'It’s a sensory overload nobody could understand,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. 'I’ve been doing this for 25 years and I’ve walked 18 other people out of prison, and I still have no idea what that experience is like unless you’re in their head. Once he enters the Carl's Jr restaurant, at the counter (above) he asks for 'a burger they show on TV with the bacon on it' After taking his first bite (Hanline pictured above eating the cheeseburger), he said 'that's what meat tastes like huh?' Once inside of Carl's Jr, Hanline takes a few moments stumbling to figure out what to order but then says he wants a burger that is 'seen in commercials' before tucking into his meal. 'Inside of Carl’s Jr it was a beautiful moment and also a sad one,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. 'He looks at the menu and he hasn’t made choices in 36 years, being in prison took away his choice and he eats what he’s told to eat. 'You can see he’s sort of stunned by that whole process. I didn't know what to get him either because I’m a vegetarian and it was my first time inside of Carl's Jr, so I just told them to give him the biggest one.' On Twitter, Carl's Jr announced on Thursday they were giving him a year of free burgers. The company wrote: 'Michael, thank you for choosing Carl's Jr./Hardee's. Hope you enjoyed it. Here's a few more' After learning of Hanline's story, Carl's Jr shared on Twitter they would be giving him a year of free burgers. 'Michael, thank you for choosing Carl's Jr./Hardee's. Hope you enjoyed it. Here's a few more,' the company tweeted to CIP on Thursday evening with a pictured attached that said 'Free burgers for a year, Michael 2015'. Brooks said Hanline was really excited about the offer from Carl's Jr. After Hanline's murder charges were formally dismissed on Wednesday, he appeared with a white beard and pony tail outside of court with his wife, Sandy, where he said he was hoping to return to a normal life. He also had a GPS monitor cut off allowing him to finally put on the boots he last wore 36 years ago when he went to prison for the crime he did not commit, according to CIP. 'All I want to do is go fishing and ride my bike and spend time with Sandy and do a little gardening,' he said outside of court in California on Wednesday. 'Hopefully everything is going to be like it used to be.' He added that he had been riding a motorcycle ever since his release and complained that California roads had gotten bumpier during his years behind bars. Following the judge dismissing him of charges on Wednesday (Hanline pictured left with his wife Sandy on April 22 and right on November 24, 2014), he said he is looking forward to returning to a normal life . California Innocence Project wrote back to Carl's Jr saying Hanline was thrilled to hear about the free burgers . 'Mike said it’s like being reborn  everyday and that the world has changed so much in 36 years,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. After decades in prison, Hanline, who lives in Paso Robles, was also coming to terms with 21st century living and talked about 'Buck Rogers' gadgets such as cellphones. 'Gas isn't 32 cents and a pack of cigarettes isn't 30 cents,' he said. 'It's a whole new ball game.' Hanline was in his early thirties when he was charged with killing friend, Ventura resident J.T. McGarry in 1978. He said he kept waiting for justice to prevail but had no idea that he would spent the next 36 years in prison. Testing showed new DNA evidence found at the crime scene did not come from Hanline or his alleged accomplice. In addition, prosecutors withheld evidence that should have been disclosed to Hanline's legal team during the trial. Michael Hanline leaves court after his case was dismissed of charges in Ventura, California on Wednesday, April 22 . Hanline said all he wants to do now is go fishing, ride his motorcycle and spend time with his wife Sandy . Hanline's conviction was overturned and he was freed from prison on November 24 after prosecutors told a judge doubts had been raised about the case. However, he had been required to wear a GPS ankle bracelet and had faced the possibility of a retrial. A Ventura County Superior Court judge dismissed the charges at the request of prosecutors, telling the courtroom it was done because the allegations can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 'I’ve been working on his case for 15 years and and when you spend all of that time with someone in prison and you get to walk them out, there’s no greater feeling,' Brooks told Daily Mail Online. 'If a lawyer gets to have one of those experiences, they’re lucky and I’ve gotten to have 18.' Prosecutors are still investigating who might have killed McGarry. 'When I first got arrested, I figured it might take a year or two to get this all straightened around but not 36,' Hanline said, including two years he spent in jail after his arrest but before his conviction. He added: 'I never believed I'd spend the rest of my life in prison, but man, 36 years is a long, long time.'","Michael Hanline, 69, was convicted in 1980 for murder of JT McGarry .

A first-half strike by the outstanding Aaron Ramsey was enough to see off Burnley at an intimidating Turf Moor and record an eighth win in a row by Arsene Wenger's side, the best run since The Invincibles team managed it in 2004. Arsenal have won at Sunderland, Newcastle, Manchester City and now Burnley, and picked up points at Liverpool and Everton, besides beating Manchester United in the FA Cup at Old Trafford. The only exception was a 3-2 defeat at Stoke and even then they nearly clawed back a 3-0 deficit.

CLICK HERE to see more from our brilliant Match Zone service . The new-found resolution, built on a base of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker at the back and Francis Coquelin holding in midfield, has enabled Arsenal to mount a surprising late run for the title. It is still unlikely given Chelsea are four points ahead and hold two games in hand. But should Jose Mourinho's men slip up in the first of them on Sunday at QPR, Arsenal will be waiting. After next weekend's FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley, The Gunners host Chelsea at The Emirates. Wenger seemed as pleased with his side's narrow win in Lancashire as he had done after dismantling Liverpool 4-1 at The Emirates the previous weekend. 'It was more of a fighting performance and many people question us on that side of things so I am pleased,' said the Arsenal manager, whose side also had to contend with a swirling wind in the first half. 'Coquelin contributes to the balance of the team. He can do things that other players aren't able to.' Burnley's Kieran Trippier (left) was unable to pull his side level with a 25-yard free-kick shortly after Ramsey's goal . Alexis Sanchez looks confused after a decision from referee Mike Dean as the Chilean star believes he was fouled . Mesut Ozil is surrounded by three Burnley players as the German star attacks inside Burnley's half . To pip his old enemy Mourinho, Wenger knows his side must equal the winning run of his last legendary title-winning team, and then go beyond it. 'We need a perfect run and we a need a non-perfect run from Chelsea. We can not master that, only our attitude. 'We have won 15 of the last 17 games so we are consistent. We want to keep winning of course. It is a challenge for the team.' An early goal always helps and Arsenal went ahead after 12 minutes. Mesut Ozil's shot was saved by Tom Heaton, Alexis Sanchez's rebound hit Michael Duff in the face and at the third time of asking Ramsey fired into the roof of the net for his ninth goal of the season. 'An awful goal to concede,' said Dyche, whose side are still in the bottom three but not without hope of beating the drop. Ramsey was the outsanding performer of the first half appearing to have almost limitless energy. One passage of play summed it up, one moment he was in the Arsenal wall blocking a David Jones free-kick, the next he was in the Burnley penalty area ready to try and score a second. Burnley clearly tried to rough Arsenal up a bit. Ben Mee and Michael Duff were booked, Ashley Barnes sent Hector Bellerin flying in the air. The home fans thought referee Mike Dean was being a bit soft towards the visitors but Wenger clearly didn't bear Burnley grudges, saying afterwards he hoped The Clarets would stay up. Gunners midfielder Santi Cazorla (left) is beaten by Burnley's Scott Airfield during the first 45 minutes . Sam Vokes and Laurent Koscielny take a tumble as the two sides battled it out on Saturday afternoon . Four thousand Arsenal fans were enjoying themselves and even had the temerity to sing “This is a library” as the normally voiceferous home support were stunned into temporarily silence. Arsenal's traditional soft-centre has hardened up too. Laurent Koscielny went crashing into Ashley Barnes when danger threatened though the Frenchman was relieved to see Ospina dive to his right to beat away Kieran Trippier's free-kick. Burnley left-back Ben Mee then became the game's first booking when he pushed his hand into Ramsey's face to stop the rampant No16. Santi Carzola then was close to scoring on his 100th Premier League appearance when he went close with a trademark free-kick. Among the watching spectators was Roy Hodgson though with Arsenal not having a single Englishman in their starting line-up, one hopes he made the journey north to check on Burnley's England under-21 striker Danny Ings. Arsenal ended the first half in control. Burnley's repeated fouling gave them a flurry of free-kicks and though the home crowd berated Mike Dean, it was difficult to see what else the official could have done.

If Ramsey was the key man of the first half, Coquelin impressed in the second as Burnley belatedly chased an equaliser. He broke up most things but on the rare occasions he was breached, Burnley fluffed their lines in front of goal. Scotland international George Boyd, who scored a famous winner against Manchester City last month, miskicked when a cross from Ben Mee from the left found him in front of goal. England under-21 international Danny Ings then connected with an overhead kick that was saved by David Ospina with his bright orange kit in goal. At least the Ings effort was something for England manager Roy Hodgson to note down. He'd travelled to Lancashire to find Arsenal hadn't included a single Englishman in their starting line-up and Danny Welbeck was only given eight minutes at the end . Ospina also saved from Barnes while Welbeck missed a late chance to add to Arsenal's win when he shot wide from Mesut Ozil's pass.

Burnley have six matches left and among their fixtures are games against fellow strugglers Leicester City, Hull and Aston Villa. 'In the second half we got on the front foot, went right after them. And apart from the goal we conceded, I thought we defended really well. 'There wasn't a lot in the game and it was close against Manchester City and Chelsea too. Arsene would have spoken to his players about what to expect here. 'Make no mistake, they have a fine side. They are bringing on a Danny Welbeck as a £16million substitute, that's not bad. 'Now we have got six different kinds of games left, edgy games. There is a less expectation on us than other teams around us so we can play with a bit more freedom. There is a lot of belief from us going into those games. We want to be effective enough to win them.' David Jones looks to get the better of Sanchez during a difficult second half for the Gunners .

5062,f73315c6f812fbd64e0b820ab7e0decb487243c2,"A pregnant model whose sexy selfies featuring her tight abs turned her into an overnight internet sensation has given birth to a healthy baby boy. Sarah Stage, a 30-year-old underwear model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles, welcomed James Hunter into the world on Tuesday afternoon. And despite her critics' claims that her unusually trim figure could be damage to to her unborn child, it seems their fears were unfounded. Sarah confirmed to E! that baby James weighed in at a healthy eight pounds, seven ounces and was 22 inches long at the time of his birth, adding: 'He's a big healthy boy and he got an APGAR score of eight to nine.' Scroll down for video . Ready to go: Sarah Stage took her last pregnancy selfie (pictured) on Monday, writing: 'Still waiting'.  The 30-year-old gave birth to a healthy baby boy named James Hunter the next day . Feeling hungry: Sarah shared this photo of two In-N-Out burgers on Tuesday afternoon, although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth . An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the mother-to-be came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against her unusually trim and toned figure, claiming it could be harmful to her unborn child, their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. Almost there: Sarah cradled her baby bump to in a 'sexy' purple dress to celebrate her 39th week of pregnancy . 'Yesterday afternoon, Sarah shared a photo of two In-N-Out burgers, writing, 'Cravings,' although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth. The lingerie-clad model snapped her last pregnancy selfie on Monday, which she captioned: 'Still waiting #9months [sic].' The snapshot of her in a black bra and thong underwear has been liked nearly 40,000 times since it was posted, and has earned nearly 4,000 comments. And Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram last week to share a photo of growing belly during her ninth month of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. So soon: Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she was supposed to give birth to her son . Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Proud of her bump: Sarah struck various photos for these selfies of herself in her underwear . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to pregnant Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although now it seems that their fears about the young boy's size were unfounded. Bump to bump: Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Just like dad: Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. And when she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the new mother regularly shared pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. Last week, Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refused to hide her then-eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Stylish mom: Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Looking good: Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant, two weeks before James was born . She shunned baggy dresses and instead dressed her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'","Sarah Stage, 30, welcomed James Hunter into the world on Tuesday afternoon .

11247,ff13de54d72b20246a8f6989e4fff15c3409b164,"Researchers sketching out a 'wiring diagram' for rat brains have discovered its structure is organized like the Internet. They say the animal's cerebral cortex is 'like a mini-Internet'. The first comprehensive picture of how neurons connect to one another found local networks of neurons layered like the shells in a Russian nesting doll. The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. The brain operates in a similar way, the researchers found. 'The cerebral cortex is like a mini-Internet,' said Larry Swanson, professor at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and corresponding author of a paper on the discovery. 'The Internet has countless local area networks that then connect with larger, regional networks and ultimately with the backbone of the Internet. 'The brain operates in a similar way.' The study was published on April 6 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For years, scientists looking for clues to brain function through its structure focused on what could be seen — the brain's lobes, grooves and folds. Two local networks — one governing vision and learning, and another tapped into bodily concerns like muscle and organ function — make up the inner shell of the rat's cerebral cortex. Two others — one governing smell, and another that assembles and makes sense of the information from the other three networks — make up the outer shell. This means that certain flows of information are genetically 'hardwired' into the brain, Swanson said. The discovery is the result of a massive, labor-intensive effort to organize 40 years' worth of data from peer-reviewed research articles detailing connections in rat brains. 'The data was already out there; it just needed to be compiled into a more useful format,' Swanson said. Lead author Mihail Bota of USC Dornsife created the database from more than 16,000 reports of connections, which he weighted both on the strength of the connection and the reliability of the methodology used to discover it. The process took more than 4,000 hours to complete, yielding a database that is free and available. Olaf Sporns of Indiana University subsequently performed a network analysis of the connections. A color-coded flat map of 1,923 rat cortical association macroconnections (RCAMs). The team used studies of rat brains because of the sheer volume of detailed information available. Swanson believes that the database can create an important link between human brain studies — which are largely done as non-invasive functional magnetic resonance imaging scans — and rat brain studies, which can be more in-depth. 'Having a wiring diagram for the brain will allow knowledge to flow both ways between human and animal studies,' Swanson said. 'This allows us to take theories from human brain scan studies and experimentally verify them in animals, and discoveries made in animal studies are likely to have an analogue in humans.' 'We're bridging the gap between our work in rat brains and the Stevens Institute's work with human brains,' Swanson said. 'If we can connect these two veins of neuroscience in a concrete and meaningful way, then we can dramatically expand our reservoir of information about the brain practically overnight.' In the future, Swanson hopes to be able to expand the neural-connection map of the rat brain beyond the cerebral cortex, some day mapping the entire nervous system.","Researchers say the cerebral cortex of rats is 'like a mini-Internet'

1570,d093d988ba09940c73f8a793a159f8eadefa4882,"Dashcam footage has revealed the startling moment a Texas trooper ran toward a motorcyclist following a high-speed chase, leaped into the air and karate kicked him to the ground. The unconventional maneuver led to a three-day, unpaid suspension for Trooper Abraham Martinez last year but the footage only emerged this week as the Austin American Statesman investigated outdated tactics used in Department of Public Safety pursuits. The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran trooper, took chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near Houston. Gaydos knew he was being pursued but drove off because he was driving on a suspended license. Jump: Trooper Abraham Martinez is seen leaping into the air to kick Steven Gaydos after he fled from authorities in Houston in 2012 as he drove in a suspended license . Contact: Martinez was ultimately suspended for three days without pay for the unconventional tactic . 'I took off, thinking I could easily lose him,' he said in a later interview. But troopers followed Gaydos for nearly 40 miles at speeds of 130 mph before Martinez pulled alongside him and fired four times through the window of his moving car, striking the man once in the thigh. The motorcyclist then raised his hand and pulled over and, as he tried to put down his kickstand, Martinez suddenly leaped out at him, kicked him and knocked him to the ground. Gaydos was arrested for evading law enforcement, driving with an invalid license and possessing a prescription painkiller after he was found to be carrying two Percocet pills. The Statesman reported that the kick and shooting from a moving vehicle don't specifically violate the Texas Department of Public Safety rules for high-speed chases, but experts said that shooting at fleeing suspects was an area of the policy that needed updating. Knocked down: After the kick, Gaydos fell to the ground. Martinez had also shot him once in the leg . Surrender: Ahead of the kick, Gaydos could be seen raising a hand to troopers and pulling over . After the incident, Martinez said he pulled out his weapon to avoid harm coming to anyone else on the road and only intended to shoot Gaydos' tires. He did not strike the bike with any of the bullets. 'I knew that it was necessary to terminate the pursuit in order to avoid any more injuries or serious bodily injuries, possibly even deaths from happening,' he said in an interview with a supervisor. As for the kick, 'obviously we don't teach that,' he said. 'I think it's something that just comes natural to some of us.' He said he opted for the unusual move because experience taught him to act decisively in case the suspect was armed. In February 2013, a grand jury declined to indict Martinez for the shooting but he was eventually ordered to take three days off last summer for violating DPS policy by using force inconsistent with his training, the Statesman reported. Both men have declined requests to comment. Caught: Gaydos, left in his mug shot, was arrested for evading law enforcement, driving with an invalid license and possessing a prescription painkiller after he was found to be carrying two Percocet pills . Suspension: Martinez, pictured right, was suspended without pay for three days last summer but was not indicted for the shooting after he said he was trying to prevent further injuries from occurring .","Trooper Abraham Martinez jumped into the air and kicked Steven Gaydos off his bike following a high-speed chase in Houston in December 2012 .

9928,d4c77d4d2077c6ce734916af0c7af6861b93f4fd,"The Crucible Curse will be one weight on the mind of Mark Selby on Saturday, but the mercurial talents of a debutant capable of ‘absolutely murdering anybody’ will be another altogether. The world champion will have to negotiate both if he is to make history in Sheffield. It is one of the quirks of this venue that no first-time winner has retained his title the next year. While that statistical curiosity has added an element of pressure to Selby, so too has the presence of Kurt Maflin, one of four men making their first appearance in the main draw. Mark Selby poses with the trophy after winning the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible in 2014 . What an intriguing figure he is, a Londoner based in Norway who was once a child star but has reached the age of 31 without making any great dents on the game. That appears to be changing with his recent appearance in the China Open semi-final, where he lost 6-3 to Selby. He is one of only 21 players in history to have hit multiple 147 breaks in professional competitions. Maflin’s chances against the world No 1 appear slim in the extreme, but six-time runner up Jimmy White told Sportsmail: ‘He has got one of the biggest talents I have seen in the game. If he produces his game he could absolutely murder anybody. Let us see how he gets on against Selby. He is the one who could produce something magical. He is very exciting and very attacking. If they go in he can beat anyone.’ Maflin demonstrated those gifts in demolishing Steve Davis 10-1 in qualifying. But Selby ought to be a significantly different proposition, having won two titles this season ahead of his defence, which starts this morning. Selby (above) will face tournament debutant Kurt Maflin in the first round on Saturday . Maflin (above lost to Selby in the semi-final of the World Snooker China Open earlier this month . White has tipped Selby as one of his ‘three to watch, with Judd Trump and Ronnie O’Sullivan, my big favourite’. Referring to the hoodoo surrounding first-time winners, Selby said: ‘It is a curse and it is going to be difficult but I will just try my best. It shows how difficult the tournament is to win. It is in the back of my mind, you can’t take that away. Just to win it once as I did last year was a fantastic achievement for me but to win it twice and break the curse would be outstanding. ‘Even if I wasn’t defending champion I’d be nervous. It would be wrong if you didn’t get butterflies because it is such a great tournament and such a great venue. But hopefully the nerves will inspire me and I’ll play better.’ O’Sullivan begins his bid for a sixth world title against debutant Craig Steadman on Tuesday.","Mark Selby plays Kurt Maflin in first round of the World Championnship .

Brown was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, in a St. Louis suburb in August 2014. Wilson resigned in November . Attorneys said at the time that the lawsuit would also name former Officer Darren Wilson, who shot Brown. The statement Wednesday did not mention Brown, and a spokesman for the law firm said he could not provide any additional information about the lawsuit. Brown's shooting led to sometimes-violent protests and spawned a national 'Black Lives Matter' movement calling for changes in how police deal with minorities. A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S. Justice Department declined to prosecute Wilson, who resigned in November.

Memories Pizza in Walkerton faced criticism this week after co-owner Crystal O'Connor expressed support for a new Indiana religious objections law. Despite 'keeping a low profile' Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor went on Fox News on Thursday to discuss their comments and and the backlash they've received. It was revealed on Thursday that the pizza shop has never catered a wedding before. Scroll down for videos . In hiding: Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor said they'll re-open soon but were forced to close the doors to their pizza shop because the phones kept ringing and they didn't know if orders were fake or real . 'Anger. Bitterness. It's something I never expected or imagined when the comments were made. It's just unimaginable to me,' said Kevin when asked about the reaction to his daughter saying she would deny gay couples pizza on their wedding day. When asked if they'll ever re-open their pizza place Kevin said he initially shut down because he 'couldn't tell if they were getting real orders or fake orders' and said that the phone rang all day and all night. 'We plan to re-open soon we just don't know when,' Crystal said. A contributor from Glenn Beck's The Blaze set up the fundraising page on GoFundMe for the pizzeria, with a goal of helping 'the family stave off the burdensome cost of having the media parked out front, activists tearing them down, and no customers coming in'. Controversy: The O'Connors made their comments a week after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed, forbidding state or local government from 'substantially 'burdening' a person's right to their beliefs . up in arms: Demonstrators  gather outside the City County Building on March 30 in Indianapolis to protest the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act . A new Indiana law passed yesterday states that no one has the legal right to 'refuse to offer or provide' goods, services, facilities or employment to anyone in previously protected classes or based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The news comes a little after a week  Indiana passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which critics say would allow businesses to openly discriminate against gays, and just a few days after his daughter told a local news station they would refuse to serve a gay marriage ceremony. Speaking to ABC57 on Tuesday, Crystal O'Connor said: 'If a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no.’ According to TMZ, O'Connor tried to clarify his views, saying he would never refuse to serve gay customers, but as a Christian he disagrees with gay marriage, and so would refuse to serve a same-sex wedding. The pizza joint has been in operation for nine years. The interior of the old-fashioned eatery is adorned with crosses and bible quotes. Just outside the pizzeria, a signs states that the staff begin each morning with a prayer. 'We are a Christian establishment,' Crystal O’Connor confirmed, but pointed out that their business practices are not biased. Shuttered: Memories Pizza in Indiana, whose owners Crystal and Kevin O'Connor (pictured) said they would refuse to cater a gay wedding, closed its doors after being abused over the phone and online . ‘We're not discriminating against anyone, that's just our belief and anyone has the right to believe in anything,’ insisted O'Connor. When Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a Republican, signed the controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week, the O’Connor family in Walkerton applauded his decision. The measure prohibits state and local government from ‘substantially burdening’ the ability of people — including businesses — to follow their religious beliefs. Pence said in a statement last Thursday that the bill ensures ‘religious liberty is fully protected under Indiana law.’ Critics of the legislation said it could allow discrimination against gay people, but its supporters claimed the bill merely seeks to prevent the government from compelling people to provide such things as catering or photography for same-sex weddings or other activities they find objectionable on religious grounds. Several reviewers invoked Adolf Hitler and the KKK in their eviscerating assessments of the pizzeria but they have since been taken down . Crystal O’Connor, of Memories Pizza, dismissed discrimination concerns, saying the law is not targeting gays - it merely helps people that have strong religious beliefs. She added that as a devout Christian, she does not support same-sex marriage – a conviction shared by her father. He said: ‘That lifestyle is something they choose. I choose to be heterosexual. They choose to be homosexual. Why should I be beat over the head to go along with something they choose?’ The Facebook and Yelp pages for the restaurant about 20 miles southwest of South Bend were bombarded with over 300 mixed reviews and their pizza place has currently just 2.5 stars following the family's controversial statements. A coach of a high school golf program was suspended after a Twitter post he wrote mentioned going to Walkerton and burning down the restaurant. The picture section of the review page has was swamped with images, some of which contain explicit content, supporting homosexuality and gay rights. It appears as though those images have since been taken down. One five-star review, written from the point of view of 'Adolf. H' no longer on the page stated: ‘Memories Pizza had been recommended to me by my buddy Herman years ago - and his praise was well deserved. ‘The largely Aryan ownership manages their subhuman staff quite well. No y*** or q****s to speak of and the tomato sauce was pretty decent for canned.’ No longer on yelp: The pizzeria's Yelp page was targeted by those who disagreed with the O'Connors' statements, attracting hundreds of one star reviews, some of which were removed . User Marco V. wrote in his review in part: 'You don't want sinners coming into your business? guess what? We are all sinners.' The review was accompanied by a meme of Crystal O'Connor with a speech bubble that read: 'Jesus said bigotry is great for sales!' Many Yelpers mocked Ms O’Connor’s suggestion that anyone would want to order pizza for their wedding reception. 'As a pizza loving lesbian - I would NEVER serve pizza at my wedding. Morons,' fumed Laura D from Long Beach, New York. Another critic of the Walkerton establishment joked that their discriminatory practices did not go far enough. ‘I’m ANGRY and will never order pizza from these people again because they're simply not discriminatory enough! I mean, just ""gays""? What about anyone who works on Sundays (Leviticus 23:3)? People who wear makeup (Jeremiah 4:30)? Hungry people (Proverbs 23:2)? Men without beards (Leviticus 19:27)? Tattooed people (Leviticus 19:28)? People who eat shellfish (Leviticus 11:10)? People with messy hair (Leviticus 10:6)? New mothers (Leviticus 12:4-5)? Psychics or mediums (Leviticus 20:27)?’ A small number of people have come to the O’Connors' defense amid an avalanche of negative comments. Lori Childers wrote on the eatery’s Facebook page: ‘God Bless you for standing up for your rights, its YOUR business and you should run it however you see fit. Sick of LBGT denying me of my God given rights. Go find another store to shop at or hey open your own store.......’ Governor Pence addressed the backlash against the bill in a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece published Monday, writing that he abhors discrimination. 'If I saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, I wouldn’t eat there anymore,' he said.","Despite 'keeping a low profile' Crystal O'Connor and her father Kevin O'Connor went on Fox News to discuss their controversial comments .

8304,1ba3018dd4f189bad20eb883e8a948ffe4444c79,"A leading bank official has been fired after being exposed as a Nazi-themed dominatrix. The 46-year-old had worked at the central bank of the Netherlands for eight years. However, for the past six of them, she has also been offering her sexual services at more than £300 an hour. Identified only by her ‘professional’ name, Conchita van der Waal, she asked clients for requests, saying ‘the kinkier the better’. Conchita van der Waal, pictured, offered a range of 'kinky' sexual services to clients from €450 an hour . Van der Waal’s website, which has been taken offline, shows a range of provocative images, including one of her wearing an SS cap. She advises prospective clients: ‘I have a challenging career in international finance. It takes me to many places (mainly western Europe and America). ‘Business meetings, elegant suits, lace stockings, garter belts, hold-ups, stiletto heels. If only my colleagues, clients or boss knew that at night I enjoy my hobby of being a hooker.’ Her online advert advises that she is a native Dutch blonde who is a ‘high-class nymphomaniac and prostitute’. She describes her greatest passion as ‘raunchy kinky sex with wild strangers and naughty men’. Quote, a Dutch magazine, reported that van der Waal had a ‘supervisory’ role at her country’s central bank while specialising in sadomasochism in her spare time. After the magazine broke the story, the bank confirmed it had fired her over ‘integrity issues’. Prostitution in Holland is legal although workers at the Dutch central bank are not allowed to engage in any activities which could bring the institution into disrepute, such as ‘indecent behaviour’. Van der Waal hinted at her real professional life on her website which has since been removed from the web . The Dutch Central Bank, pictured, told a magazine that van der Waal had been fired over 'integrity issues' It is claimed that van der Waal previously worked with ABN-AMRO, a state-owned bank based in Amsterdam. She is also understood to have worked for Dutch bank ING, which was fined £417million in 2012 for violating US economic sanctions. It is not clear when she was employed by either institution. According to her website, van der Waal’s work outside the financial sector was far more exciting. A picture from one of her online adverts shows the blonde sex worker sprawled across a zebra-print double bed. She wears a revealing leopard-print dress, surrounded by lit candles, champagne flutes and an ice bucket. The picture and the online advert vanished from the internet soon after her identity was exposed. But the images were captured and reproduced by Quote magazine before they were taken down. According to the Irish Times, van der Waal could face further action from Dutch authorities because she failed to register officially as a prostitute or abide by tax rules. Sex workers in the Netherlands must ensure they have a VAT number and pay income tax, none of which the woman has reportedly done so far. And she may also face difficulties because her ‘S&M studio’ is reportedly in a building where ‘immoral’ behaviour is specifically outlawed under the terms of the contract under which it was bought in 2012. Following the revelations, the Dutch central bank said it would review screening procedures for new employees. It said that of the 5,469 prospective staff who had been screened since 2011, 614 had been rejected. But the firm has been criticised by some in the Netherlands for treating the woman unfairly by firing her. Prostitution in the country was legalised in 2000 in order to protect women through better regulation and employment rights.","Conchita van der Waal offered a range of 'kinky' services for €450 an hour .

The 25-year-old, who has impressed at both left and right back for the Eagles this season, has been a mainstay in the first team, making 35 appearances in all competitions. Speaking to the club's official website about his new deal, Ward said: 'I'm really pleased. It's been something that has been talked about a little bit and I'm glad to now put that to the back and just concentrate with my football and I'm delighted to have signed the deal.' Crystal Palace right back Joel Ward has signed a new three-and-a-half year deal with the south London club . Ward has played 101 times for the Eagles since joining from boyhood club Portsmouth in May 2012 . Ward has played every minute of Palace's Premier League campaign this season, under three different managers, and his performances have warranted some shouts for an England call-up. Last week's win over champions Manchester City saw Ward make his 100th appearance for Palace, and he cites the influence of manager Alan Pardew in his decision to sign a new deal. 'The relationship with the gaffer and the club helped. I'm excited for what the next few years have in store.

For the first time in the annals of boxing – as Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao step on the scales next Friday – fans will be charged for admission to a weigh-in. This formality for checking that combatants weigh no more than the stipulated poundage for each division started to become an event in its own right in 2007 when Ricky Hatton went to Las Vegas to take his Man Of La Mancha tilt at the Mayweather windmill. Floyd Mayweather with girlfriend Doralie Medina (left) and Manny Pacquiao with his wife Jinkee (right) Pacquiao with his wife and  children (left to right) Michael, Israel, Emmanuel, Princess and Queen Elizabeth . Mayweather visits SubZero Recovery in Las Vegas, a new-age version of the ice bath . No fewer than 30,000 of the Manchester Hitman's army followed him across the Atlantic and thousands of them turned up for the weigh-in. The atmosphere was electrified when Hatton yelled 'let's be having him' as Mayweather was about to follow him onto the stage. Hatton would be knocked out but there was more of the same when he went back to the MGM Grand to suffer the same fate against Pacquiao two years later. Since then weigh-ins there have turned into sound and light spectacles, taking place inside the Grand Garden Arena itself, and the audiences keep growing. The decision to sell tickets for this one has been made in the interests of safety, not profit. Up to 200,000 visitors are expected to pour into Vegas this fight week and the MGM need to control the crowds at all the associated events. Thousands of fans watched Ricky Hatton and Mayweather weigh-in at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . Hatton points towards the crowd during his heated weigh-in with Mayweather in December 2007 . Mayweather poses in his TMT clothing as he takes a break from training over the weekend . To avoid accusations of cashing in on the phenomenon the hotel and both promoters – Mayweather and Top Rank – will donate all revenue from the weigh-in to charities nominated by the Money Man and the PacMan. Mayweather and Pacquiao will be required to weigh not more than 10st 7lbs. The winner will unify the WBC (Mayweather) and WBO (Pacquiao) world welterweight titles. Wladimir Klitschko, as he makes a rare appearance in the US this Saturday, admits that at 39 he has to start considering when he might hang up those huge gloves. However, assuming he adds Bryant Jennings to his long list of victims, that will not happen before Dr Iron Fist has obliged the two young pretenders to his heavyweight throne. Namely our own Tyson Fury and America's KO sensation Deontay Wilder. Wladimir Klitschko has admitted that he is considering retirement as he approaches his 40th birthday . Klitschko says: 'I do have to start thinking about retirement.' But then the Ukrainian who boxes mostly to sell-out crowds in German football stadia, adds: 'I would like to fight Fury, which would be a huge event in Europe. 'I want to fight Wilder, to add the only remaining belt to my unified world titles.' Unusually, both men would present Klitschko with opposition as tall or, in Fury's case, even taller than his own 6ft 6in. Fury is his mandatory challenger for the WBO title. Wilder holds the WBC title which was vacated by Klitschko's brother Vitali when he retired to concentrate on the violent complexities of Ukrainian politics as Mayor of Kiev. WBC heavyweight champions Deontay Wilder looks set to face Klitschko before he hangs up his gloves . Wladimir is also the WBA, IBF, IBO and Ring magazine champion. There is another factor which will tempt him to prolong his reign even further. Currently he ranks fourth in the all-time list of successive world heavyweight title defences, with 18. Victories over Jennings – which looks to be something of a formality in New York's Madison Square Garden, would lift him level with Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes on 19. If he adds wins over Fury and Wilder he will close to within just four victories of the 25-defences record held by Joe Louis. That is likely to be an opportunity too good to refuse. Tyson Fury, pictured in action against Dereck Chisora, is Klitschko's mandatory challenger for the WBO title . The crushing defeat of Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr by the largely unheralded and, in terms of his first name, unpronounceable Pole Andrzej Fonfara, complicates Carl Froch's exit strategy from the ring. One of Froch's two dream scenarios has been a farewell fight in Las Vegas, probably against Chavez with his box office appeal for America's Hispanic population and fans south of the border in Mexico. But the namesake son of an idolised father was so badly beaten up through nine rounds in California by Fonfara – suffering the first knock down of his career in the process – that he quit on his stool. Carl Froch could choose to retire after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr's defeat by Andrzej Fonfara last week . Inadvisedly, Chavez had agreed to a catch-weight fight with light-heavyweight contender Fonfara and is talking about going back down to Froch's super-middleweight division. Whether this former middleweight champion would still be a draw after this setback is doubtful and Froch had said before the fight that it would hurt his plans 'if Chavez got knocked out. The other swansong ambition – to fight on the City Ground of his beloved Nottingham Forest – suffered a setback when Andre Ward agreed to come to England for their mandatory WBA title unifier but not to Froch's home town. Retirement is becoming an increasingly attractive option for the Cobra.

She has been charged with second-degree assault and second-degree strangulation . Engelhardt refused to speak with McKenzie, telling her to first get a security pass. A fight then ensued. Authorities say the teacher was shoved against the wall, placed in a headlock and thrown to the floor. Several students also became involved in the attack, including McKenzie's 14-year-old niece. Another teacher was able to break up the melee and attend to Engelhardt. She was unconscious for several minutes and rushed to Winthrop University Hospital.

Speaking from her home to ABC 7, Engelhardt said she has long feared for her safety at the school. 'It's not like I thought a parent would do something, but I knew something violent was going to happen,' she told the network. 'I've warned (the school) time and again that the children have no respect for adults. 'Yes, I fear for my safety. They can't control the kids.'

10779,e530ab163036749343884dc2c88bc54f8b6e9e98,"Ian Gibson, a former soldier who had his kneecap blown off in combat and is suing his employer after a colleague nicknamed him Hoppy . A former soldier who had his kneecap blown off in combat more than 30 years ago is suing his employer after he was nicknamed 'Hoppy' by a colleague. Today, ex-Army tank driver Ian Gibson from Hillingdon in Middlesex told an employment tribunal that he was subjected to a tirade of 'horrible harassment' while working at H and G Contracting Services Ltd at Heathrow Airport. The 60-year-old joined the company as plane refueller in December 2007, three decades after he was medically discharged from the British Army's Parachute Regiment. His job involved kneeling down, removing a manhole cover and connecting the fuel pipe  to refuel planes. In 2010 he underwent a knee replacement and had further surgery on his other knee two years later. Mr Gibson claims that bosses failed to make his job easier after the pain in his knee became too excruciating and was overlooked for an office-based job, which was instead offered to a man he said bullied him about being disabled. He told the tribunal in Reading: 'I suffered bullying and harassment and discrimination as a result of my disability, in particular from Mike Baldwin who bullied me because of my disability and the way I walk. 'On my return to work there was no medical or risk assessment. I carried on the work without adjustments which caused further pain.' Mr Gibson added that he was offered a temporary admin role in the workshop at the firm in November 2013. However, when he lodged a grievance complaint about the bullying, he was told his admin job would not be made permanent. He also claimed he was not informed about a vacancy for a workshop/site service manager role when he was off work. He added: ' I feel the reason was because I lodged a grievance and was a hassle to the company. 'I think I was deliberately not informed of the position. Mike Baldwin told me he had already been offered the job before I was given an interview. 'He called me ""Hoppy"" because of my limp. The way I walk has been a real difficulty for me. He said to me ""they could get a tart in for £16,000 to do your job, disabled or not so watch yourself"". 'In April 2014, he called me 'Hoppy' and said ""I don't know why you joined the Army, jumping out of planes for what? This f****d up country, you must be f*****g stupid, look at you, it has left you with f***** up legs"".' Mr Gibson claimed he was subjected to the bullying and harassment while working at Heathrow Airport, pictured,  for H and G Contracting Services Ltd  (file picture) Naomi Cunningham, representing H and G Contracting Services Ltd, challenged Mr Gibson asking him if the nickname was just 'harmless'. But he added: 'To you it might be, to me it isn't I got a limp serving this country if you want to go down that route. 'My grandchildren do not like coming around as much as they used to call me grumpy granddad.' Miss Cunningham also said the company might have had no reason to think Mr Gibson was suitable for the job of a site service manager due to a lack of experience and that the office-based job was always meant to be permanent. But the grandfather replied: 'There was scores missing from my CV. I had one night to do it, I had been with H and G for years. 'It was a temporary job but I was told to keep working hard and management will try and get it permanent for me. I was under that impression.'","Ian Gibson claims he was bullied at H and G Contracting Services Ltd .

3118,c5dcaf5c23ff823fc9ab67eed14d82cdcf77bddb,"Richie Benaud made commentary look easy. Believe me, it isn’t. But he put in the hard work and he rose to the top. There’s a lesson there for a few of the blokes who pick up a mic today. I had the great honour of doing a stint on Channel 9 in Australia during an Ashes Test a few years ago. They’d only recently introduced the concept of using three commentators in one go and, as usual, Richie was keeping his contributions to a minimum. I mean that in a good way — again, another lesson for today’s batch. Anyway, Richie had noticed something out in the middle and flicked what we call the lazy switch, so he could have a quiet word with the producer without the viewers hearing him. He wanted some footage of an incident he’d spotted a couple of overs earlier — Shane Warne had done something in the slips and it had passed the rest of us by. Richie Benaud was one of cricket's great personalities and will be remembered for his dry wit and knowledge . Benaud was the voice of cricket for generations, commentating in his native Australia and for the BBC . Benaud, pictured on his wedding day to wife Daphne, and during his later years in August 2005 . Benaud was a daring captain and became the first cricketer to score 2,000 runs and take 200 wickets in Tests . Finally, the producer located what he wanted. Warne, who hadn’t bowled yet — but who would go on to skittle England for the umpteenth time — had picked up his bowling marker, a small white disc, and thrown it to where he thought he’d be starting his run-up. Between overs, they broadcast Warne’s gesture. Richie said: ‘Shane Warne’s just put a marker down.’ That was his only contribution in the half-hour we were on together, but it beat anything else we had to offer. One line! It was classic Richie: he had the eagle eye to see what Warne was doing in the first place, the confidence to stay quiet while we rabbited on, and the perfect choice of words. As he might have put it himself: marvellous. I thought of Richie during the World Cup final last month. For some reason Star Sports, the tournament’s global broadcasters, used a team of rookies to commentate on the match. Some of them were among the game’s greatest modern-day players, but it was painfully apparent none of them had done much commentary. It was terrible TV. They just couldn’t pinpoint the moment — no emotion, no elation, no despair. How we missed Richie that evening. He never went overboard but he could have captured all those qualities in that understated way of his. Sometimes he could be very understated indeed. David Gower, Geoffrey Boycott and Benaud assembled a formidable line-up for the BBC in 1995 . A master with the microphone to his lips, Benaud also was well aware of the power of silence . Australia cricket legend Benaud shakes hands with HM Queen Elizabeth II during his playing days . I remember talking to Michael Slater, who teamed up with him in the commentary box in his later years. He spoke about one day when Richie did two half-hour stints as one of three commentators, and did not say a single word. Slats described it as ‘bagging a pair’, the term for a batsman who gets two ducks. But that was Richie. If there was nothing to add to the picture the viewers could see, he wouldn’t add to it. It really pains me now, for example, when commentators start reading out a graphic that has appeared on screen for all to see. It might be the top 10 leading runscorers at a particular ground, or something similar, and they just read out the list! It’s incredibly lazy. Richie would consider the list, and then say something like: ‘And No 4 could soon be moving to No 2.’ He wouldn’t even name names — he respected the intelligence of the viewer. And I know how much viewers responded to that. One of his best qualities was that he never sought the limelight. He wasn’t in it for the ego. He’d turn up in the commentary box and if he was off-air, he’d set up at the back of the box, take out his computer and do his homework on the newest player on the scene, or look up the latest horseracing odds. The chemistry he had with the likes of Tony Greig and Bill Lawry was amazing. It was unmissable. And it was based on a deep mutual respect and love of the game. Benaud (front left) leads Australia off at Old Trafford in 1961 as England collapsed against his leg spin . Benaud, pictured in 2006 during the launch of his book My Take on Cricket, was widely respected and loved . Benaud pays tribute to Australian media mogul and cricket pioneer Kerry Packer after his death in 2005 . And, boy, he loved the game. One evening, Richie, Ron Atkinson and I were treated to dinner in Birmingham by the News of the World, who we were all working for at the time. Ron was covered in bling and telling us all how he could get into any nightclub in town and was ready for a lively evening. Richie wasn’t a big drinker, but he’d allowed himself a couple of glasses of red, and he started telling this story about the great Australian leg-spinner Bill O’Reilly. It’s fair to say the story was on the longish side and by the time Ron had disappeared into the night and Richie was being bundled into a waiting taxi, we were still learning all about Bill O’Reilly… . He had this wit that made all other commentators want to be like him. He didn’t really go in for after-dinner speaking, but he might occasionally be asked to say a few words. Once he spotted me in the audience, and quickly remembered the time I was hit in the groin by Jeff Thomson (have I mentioned that before?). Tributes are seen at the statue of Benaud at the Sydney Cricket Ground after his passing aged 84 . ‘Ah, there’s David Lloyd,’ Richie said. ‘I remember him telling me in 1974-75 how he could play Thommo with his c***… and then he proceeded to do precisely that.’ The joke was all in the pause and the timing. He was a great leg-spinner, a superb captain, and a lovely bloke. I can just imagine how warmly he’ll be welcomed by some of the other great commentators up in the sky: Brian Johnston, Alan McGilvray, John Arlott, even Freddie Trueman. Fred was often known to splutter: ‘I just don’t know what’s going off out there.’ Richie, it’s safe to say, never suffered from the same affliction. We’ll miss him dearly. And so will cricket. ON COMMENTATING . 'What I want most from being a television commentator is to be able to feel that, when I say something, I am talking to friends.' 'My mantra is: put your brain into gear and if you can add to what's on the screen then do it, otherwise shut up.' 'The key thing was to learn the value of economy with words and to never insult the viewer by telling them what they can already see.' 'Out in the field, you haven't got anyone whispering into your ear saying all sorts of things, you've got to do it yourself.' ON CAPTAINCY . 'The hallmark of a great captain is the ability to win the toss, at the right time.' 'Captaincy is 90 per cent luck and 10 per cent skill. But don't try it without that 10 per cent.' ON BATTING . 'Bruce Reid is not the worst batsman there is at international level but those who are worse would not need to hire the Myer Music Bowl to hold a convention.' 'Glenn McGrath dismissed for two, just ninety-eight runs short of his century.' 'He's not quite got hold of that one. If he had, it would have gone for nine.' ON BOWLING . 'A bleeding ring finger at the end of every training session was not only normal but essential for my development as a wrist spinner.' 'Your wrist must be cocked, but not stiffly cocked.' 'You must always look where you want to land it. If I offered you 10,000 dollars to hit a tin can, you'd never take your eyes off it.' ON TWENTY20 CRICKET . 'If any form of game can pull 20,000 spectators into a game of cricket it's great for the sport. I think it's wonderful.' 'As long as the people who run the game have brains and keep three forms of the game I think it will be terrific.' ON SHANE WARNE'S 'BALL OF THE CENTURY . 'Gatting has absolutely no idea what has happened to it. Still doesn't know.' ON 1981's 'UNDERARM BOWLING' SCANDAL . 'A disgraceful performance from a captain who got his sums wrong. It should never be permitted to happen again. One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field.' MISCELLANEOUS .

Bayern Munich take on Porto on Wednesday night and even though they are contending with an injury crisis which leaves them without Bastian Schweinsteiger, Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben among others you might anticipate a sixth Champions League semi-final for Guardiola in his six years of management. Of course Guardiola isn't alone responsible for the decline of the Premier League in Europe; nor is it really down to St Andrews, though the iconic town with its genteel ambience played its part in continental Europe overhauling the English clubs. Pep Guardiola prepares his side for their Champions League quarter-final first leg against Porto . The Bayern boss gives instructions to his goalkeeper Manuel Neuer at a training session on Tuesday . Something happened back in 2008 when Guardiola took over at Barcelona and it wasn't that the Barcelona team changed. Frank Rijkaard had virtually the same players but Guardiola managed to find an extra 25 per cent of performance in them. What happened was a tactical change which had at its roots in St Andrews, where the Barcelona team spent their first pre season under Guardiola. There Messi was a distracted individual, sometimes sneering at Guardiola's insistence on organisation and pressing, according to Guillem Balague's account in his biographies of Messi and Guardiola. But a breakthrough came when Guardiola stuck up for Messi in his battle with the club to play for Argentina in the Beijing Olympics. The new manager took the young Argentinian under his wing, sidling up to him after training, putting his arm round him to assure him of his support. Guardiola is bidding to reach his sixth Champions League semi-final in his six years as a manager . Guardiola got Messi on side in 2008 after standing up for him in battle to represent Argentina at the Beijing Olympics . Messi, the precocious star, suddenly felt he had an ally in Guardiola. And, as a result, he began to buy into Guardiola's idea of relentless pressing to supplement the tiki taka football, which was already a template at Barcelona. For tiki taka is not what made Guardiola’s team great. 'I loathe all that passing for the sake of it, all that tiki-taka. It's rubbish and has no purpose.' It sounds like Sam Allardyce, but those are the words of the great high priest of possession football as reported by Marti Perarnau in his book Pep Confidential. What Guardiola added to Barcelona’s game was the intensity, drive and sheer energy which had wilted under Rijkaard and then moulded it with overwhelming possession. Sometimes, when assessing the English problem in Europe, it helps to reverse the question. So, rather than ask 'Why are we so bad now?' it useful to identify why were we so good between 2005-2009?' Guardiola led Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011 (pictured) The former Barcelona manager is thrown into the air by his players as they celebrate the 2011 success . For Chelsea fans pointing to the 2012 triumph, that it was indeed a victory of rare courage amidst adversity but the decline of English clubs had already begun and that win is effectively an outlier, bucking the established trend. Between 2005-2009 the Premier League provided 12 out of the potential 20 semi finalists for the Champions League; between 2010 to 2015 it has provided three out of 24. Even asking that question is revealing as what English clubs were really good at during that period was making the semi finals and the final rather than winning the trophy. Only Liverpool and Manchester United actually achieved that in the five-year period of English ascendancy, though, of course, Chelsea did so improbably in 2012. What was different about English clubs in that period was the injection of some of the finest tactical minds in the game to the Premier League. Jose Mourinho may never have won the trophy with Chelsea but he transformed their approach and arguably provided the foundations for the 2008 final and the remarkable 2012 win. Rafael Benitez was an extraordinary force, the Diego Simeone of that era, regularly out-witting Mourinho and taking a relatively normal Liverpool team to two finals. Guus Hiddink engineered a fine run to the semi finals building on the work of Mourinho. Manchester United won the Champions League in 2008 when English clubs were dominating the latter stages . Chelsea were an exception to the rule in 2012 when they won the tournament against all the odds . Rising to the challenge of Mourinho and Benitez, Sir Alex Ferguson was tactically at his peak in that period, playing without a recognised centre foward at times in 2008 before Guardiola and others made it fashionable. English teams had always had an intensity with which continental teams had sometimes struggled to cope. What they had lacked often was organisation and tactical nous. Benitez, Mourinho, Hiddink provided that and Ferguson responded. Put all that together and you have a cultural melting pot which, allied to the commercial success of the Premier League, was pushing players and teams to new heights. The Premier League’s TV money of course brought in good, technical foreign players which helped but that does not seem to be the key reason for its success. The money is bigger now and those players still come but it hasn't helped Manchester City. At the zenith of the Premier League's dominance, the 2008 Moscow final, ten English players started the game. Manchester City were eliminated in the last 16 this season at the hands of Barcelona . Chelsea exited at the same stage as England have no representatives in the quarter-finals . When Jurgen Klinsmann spoke about the tactical revolution he was attempting to forge in Germany in 2006 - a style of play which has since evolved at Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich - he explicitly referenced the Premier League and its pace. He recognised that continental Europe had fallen behind. It was new tactical ideas meeting the traditional attributes of the English game which helped the Premier League dominate Europe. Conversely, it was Guardiola - and others, such as Jurgen Klopp, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes - surpassing that intensity which in turn overhauled the Premier League. Clubs such as Barca, Bayern, Dortmund have retained their technical superiority over English clubs but they are now likely to out-run them and out-press them. In reality there is no one man responsible for that change. And, Guardiola's obsession with pressing is rooted in an admiration for South American football and especially Marcelo Bielsa, rather than the Premier League. But when that change took place, the Premier League lost its competitive edge. And when Guardiola put his arm around Messi at St Andrews back in the summer of 2008 and convinced his young protege to buy into that pressing game, European football changed forever.","Bayern Munich take on Porto in the Champions League quarter-final .

10046,3c2242c8c19c1149cfb8a03442812b84d3122d6d,"(CNN)Robert Bates says he gets it, how you might wonder how a cop could confuse a pistol for a stun gun. Bates -- the Tulsa County, Oklahoma, reserve sheriff's deputy accused of manslaughter in the death of a fleeing suspect -- told NBC's ""Today"" show Friday that he used to think that, too. ""Believe me,"" he told the show in his first appearance since being charged in the April 2 death of Eric Harris, ""it can happen to anyone."" Harris died after Bates shot him -- accidentally, he says -- after calling out ""Taser! Taser!"" in a tussle captured on a police body camera. Bates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun. How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? While Bates is at the center of the maelstrom over Harris' death, he isn't the only one under scrutiny. The Oklahoma NAACP wants charges against other officers involved in Harris' death, and a state and federal investigation into the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office's treatment of minorities. The sheriff's office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge Bates' training records. In his interview Friday with ""Today,"" Bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies. ""That is absolutely the truth. I have it in writing,"" he told the show. And on Thursday, a sheriff's office official denied to the Tulsa World newspaper that any records had ever been forged. As an advanced reserve deputy, sheriff's office policy calls for Bates to have completed 480 hours of the field training officer program, according to the Tulsa World. Bates would also have needed firearms certification training. Officials have yet to locate records showing what training Bates completed, said Maj. Shannon Clark of the sheriff's office. But Clark did say it's possible that some training requirements may have been waived. Sheriff Stanley Glanz has the authority to waive any department policies, Clark said. ""The policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff, but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization. That's part of being a sheriff's office,"" Clark told the newspaper. Glanz told KFAQ radio this week that officials can't find records of Bates' firearms certification. The instructor who provided that training is now a U.S. Secret Service agent, and officials haven't been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in, Glanz told the station. Other discrepancies have surfaced about training that Bates claims to have attended, including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction. Tulsa World reporter Dylan Goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that Bates' records had been falsified. The newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why. But the orders apparently started years ago, ""back when (Bates) was trying to get on as a deputy,"" reporter Ziva Branstetter told CNN's ""New Day."" Bates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to Glanz's re-election campaign, leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop. He rejected that claim in the ""Today"" interview as ""unbelievably unfair."" Bates' attorney, Clark Brewster, also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded. He said those making the accusations include fired sheriff's office employees represented by the law firm that also represents Harris' family. ""His training is extensive and certainly adequate,"" Brewster told CNN on Thursday. Bates appeared on the ""Today"" show with his wife, two daughters and Brewster. He seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened. ""I can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days,"" Bates said. ""I'm not at all sure it's not still with me today. Lack of sleep, inability to concentrate, all of those plus more. You know, I still can't believe it happened."" In describing the events leading up to Harris' death, Bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch Harris in the act of illegally selling a gun. Bates said he had participated in ""several hundred"" such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and ""clean up"" after deputies, taking photos and notes. But as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale, Harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward Bates' position. As deputies were trying to subdue Harris, Bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control. ""I yelled, 'Taser! Taser!' as required in training. The deputy below me ducked, he pulled away from it so that I could,"" Bates said. ""The laser light is the same on each weapon. I saw the light and I squeezed the trigger,"" Bates told ""Today."" The result was not the staccato click of a well-deployed stun gun. Instead, it was a gunshot. ""I shot him! I'm sorry!"" Bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident. Bates apologized to Harris' family, who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, said this week that he didn't think the shooting was racially motivated. Instead, he said, ""This is simply evil."" But Bates,who is charged with second-degree manslaughter, said he didn't mean to kill Harris. His attorney has called it an ""excusable homicide."" ""I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret,"" said Bates, who is free on $25,000 bail.","""I rate this as No. 1 on my list of things in my life that I regret,"" Robert Bates tells ""Today""

Shayna Hubers has been charged with murder in the October 12, 2012, of 29-year-old Ryan Poston inside his condominium in Highland Heights, Ohio. Hubers, who was 21 at the time, claimed she was acting in self-defense because the young attorney was shoving and hitting her, but during an interview with police she was quoted as telling a detective she gave Posten 'the nose job he wanted.' Gun-toting girlfriend: Shayna Hubers (left), 24, is on trial in the 2012 shooting death of her lawyer boyfriend, 29-year-old Ryan Poston . Crime scene: Police say Hubers shot Poston six times inside his Highland Heights, Ohio, condominium . On the first day of testimony Tuesday, jurors were shown a video of the defendant’s interview with police following the slaying. 'He was screaming at me at the top of his lungs after he had thrown me around the room,' the woman told a detective sitting across from her, reported Cincinnati.com. ‘I shot him enough times to kill him,’ she said, ‘so that he wouldn't suffer... He was laying there, twitching and making noises, and I shot him in the head. ‘I was watching him die. it was painful to watch him die and to know that I had done that,' reported WCPO. Hubers then described her late boyfriend of one year as 'vain' about his looks. ‘I shot him right here,’ she said in the video as she pointed to her nose. ‘I gave him his nose job he wanted.’ Gallows humor: Jurors were shown a videotaped police interview with Hubers, in which the woman, then 21, said Poston was 'vain' and she gave him the 'nose job he wanted' by shooting him in the face . Troubled: Poston's family described his relationship with Hubers, left, as tumultuous and said that the 29-year-old was trying to end it . Prosecutors argued that the woman intentionally shot the attorney six times across a table, including once in the face, after Poston tried to end their relationship. Hubers' attorneys have maintained that their client shot Poston to protect herself. During questioning, Hubers explained to detectives that she went to Poston's home ‘with the best intentions’ not to kill him, but to convince him to work out their differences and mend their relationship. But when she arrived, Poston allegedly 'resorted to violence.' The woman said the lawyer made fun of her speaking voice, insulted her family, and physically assaulted her by pushing and dragging her around. She detailed how the 29-year-old victim allegedly pushed her down against the arm of the couch and threw her against furniture in the moments before the first shot rang out. ‘He said, “You're just a hillbilly from Kentucky.” And I am. I guess the hillbilly came out in me, and I took up for myself,’ she told police in the recording played in court. Hubers’ trial is expected to last two weeks. She is being held in jail on $1.5million bond. Woman scorned: Hubers told police how Ryan Poston allegedly pushed and shoved her, insulted her family and mocked her for being a 'hillbilly from Kentucky.' She said: 'I guess the hillbilly came out in me, and I took up for myself’ Ryan Poston graduated from Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University in 2008, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and uncle. In May 2012, he started his own law practice specializing in personal injury cases in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. His family and friends have described him as a bright and hard-working young lawyer who had a promising future ahead of him. He is survived by his parents and three sisters. Hubers graduated from Lexington’s Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in 2009. In the fall of 2010, she made the Dean’s List at the University of Kentucky as a sophomore psychology major.

When Wasps claimed the Heineken Cup in 2007 with victory over Leicester, it seemed unthinkable that the Premiership would not produce another continental champion for so long. Yet since then Irish teams have seized four titles — Leinster claiming a hat-trick — and French teams three, accurately reflecting the balance of power in the European game. This season is not seen as any real exception, despite the presence of four English sides in the last eight of the new Champions Cup. There is a consensus among the bookies that holders Toulon are destined to finish on top of the pile for the third successive year, with Clermont their primary challengers followed by Racing and Leinster. The Aviva Premiership quartet are all away from home this weekend and are all firm underdogs. Francois Louw runs with the ball during the Bath Rugby training session held at Farleigh House . Bath's George Ford practices his kicking during the training session at the Farleigh House complex . Leinster's Jamie Heaslip is tackled by Sailosi Tagicakibau during the Champions Cup match with Wasps . In World Cup year it would provide a clear boost to national morale if one of their elite clubs could shatter the status quo by lifting the trophy on May 2 but there are significant reasons why an English triumph shouldn't happen. The first comes down to money. Northampton, Saracens, Bath and Wasps are well-funded, with strong squads, but their resources are modest compared to French powerhouses Toulon, Clermont and Racing, who have budgets three or four times the size of their Premiership opponents. Across the Channel, squads are awash with Test-class players from around the world, even on the bench. Meanwhile, Leinster have superb recent European pedigree and benefit from the Irish system which sees top players rested from league duties in order to peak on these major occasions.Bath will find themselves in hostile territory at the Aviva Stadium, but they went to Toulouse in January and scorched the earth to win 35-18. If their pack can go toe-to-toe with the hosts, the likes of Jonathan Joseph are capable of wreaking havoc. Make no mistake, Mike Ford's team are capable of winning in Dublin. Also on Saturday, Northampton face an arduous task in trying to storm the Stade Marcel Michelin fortress where Clermont are on a 22-match unbeaten run in Europe. The Saints are the only English team to win an away quarter-final against French opposition — beating Biarritz 7-6 in 2007. English sides have lost the eight other quarter-finals they have played across the Channel.

Nothampton's Stephen Myler (left) and Luther Burrell (right) prepare to tackle Jamie Roberts of Racing Metro . The current Premiership champions were losing Heineken Cup finalists in 2011. To reach that stage again would require a monumental result this weekend, but Clermont are far from infallible, as Saracens proved, thrashing them 46-6 in last season's epic semi-final. The London club lost to Toulon in the final, but they have been the standard-bearers for English rugby in the last two seasons and will believe they can go to Paris and beat Racing, who can be wildly inconsistent. Wasps captain James Haskell provides a link back to the club's distant 2007 success, but Dai Young's men will be confronting a multi-national force in Toulon that would beat most Test teams. If they were to stun the holders, it would go down as one of the greatest shocks in European competition. There is a fair chance that one English team can progress, with Bath and Saracens the more likely candidates. If two were to make it, that would provide a colossal and timely boost to national morale.

But not all eyes were on the pitch for the whole 90 minutes, as the German club's manager Pep Guardiola broke the highly dramatic atmosphere with a moment of sartorial comedy. To put it bluntly, he split his pants. A flash of upper thigh and navy boxers made themselves known as he strode up and down the touchline shouting commands at his players. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sartorial slip-up: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola runs through tactics with his players, while ignoring the draft that has emerged at the top of his left leg . A hint of navy: Guardiola's tight-fitting trousers before the tear (left) and after the rip (right) during Bayern Munich's 6-1 victory over Porto . The Spanish tactician, who teamed his tight, grey suit with a navy pullover, black tie and crisp white shirt, joked after the clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' Guardiola wouldn't be the only famous face guilty of stepping into a suit that is a little on the snug side. The current trend for wearing a whistle and flute that is at least a size too small, presumably to showcase a well-honed physique, has seen plenty of stars sail a little close to the wardrobe malfunction wind. So, who's guilty of worshipping at the altar of super-tight slacks? Russell Brand. Guilty. Dermot O'Leary. Guilty. Olly Murs. In danger of restricting the blood flow. Yes, it's officially a wardrobe malfunction...but has Guardiola simply fallen foul of wearing a suit that is a little on the snug side? Blame 007: Daniel Craig wore a close-fitting Tom Ford suit in 2012 Bond movie Skyfall...and thousands of men followed the trend . And breathe! If Beckham gets the snug look just right, his fellow Essex boys, including Jeff Brazier (pictured right) are guilty of going a little too tight . The rock star's take on the whistle and flute: Harry Styles doesn't bother with a jacket but his trousers are certainly skinny, while Russell Brand goes for a second (snake)skin with his casual version of the suit . King of the second skin! Dermot O'Leary rarely wears a suit that could be described as roomy . The trend for a tighter fit has emerged in recent years with 'skinny', 'slim' and 'heritage' fits all offering a snugger-looking silhouette. Cast an eye back three years and the most recent incarnation of James Bond, in Sam Mendes' 2012 movie Skyfall, was seen wearing the kind of form-fitting suit that makes you wonder how it might have been possible to wear it AND brawl on top of a train while hurtling through Turkey. Throughout the film, an unruffled Daniel Craig sported a grey, tailored suit by Tom Ford which may have been the catalyst for other celebrities wearing a similar look. During his just-ended eight-year reign on The X Factor, Dermot O'Leary's suits have got progressively smaller, seeing him once forced to reach for a safety pin moments before presenting the live show. O'Leary said at the time: 'I remember having a wardrobe malfunction on The X Factor. 'I had this tight-fitting Alexander McQueen suit and felt the trousers rip…from pole to pole, shall we say. I just had to skilfully apply a safety pin and hope for the best. It was terrifying.' High street menswear retailer Hawes & Curtis told FEMAIL that figure-hugging clothes are no longer just for women. Not much room to give! Olly Murs, who split his trousers on stage in Sheffield in 2012, sails close to the wind again here while performing at the V Festival in 2013 . A thigh-ful! Towie stars Dan Osborne and Joey Essex are both partial to leaving little to the imagination when it comes to formal wear . Edward Smith, head of brand for the company said: 'The skinny look has taken over everyone's wardrobe, regardless of gender. 'Men have been wearing tight T-shirts and shirts for a while now - our best-selling shirt is now an extra slim one. 'Remember, men don't want to look great at the weekend and then put on a baggy old suit for the working week. The office is just as much their chance to shine, so suits have had to go through a skinny transformation as much as any other garment.' Other stars who've fallen foul of their own outfits exposing them include fellow X Factor presenter Olly Murs, whose penchant for clothes that show off his best assets saw his trousers split as he performed on stage at Sheffield Arena in 2012. Wearing a matching burgundy waistcoat and pants, the star was dancing on his knees when the fabric covering his undercarriage gave way revealing sparkling white pants. For more examples, you only have to wander to the streets of Chelsea or Essex, as the reality television stars who grace our screens on The Only Way is Essex and Made in Chelsea don't appear to own a more roomy suit between them. Towie star Dan Osborne is clearly proud of his buff body and regularly showcases it in slimline attire and Joey Essex is also partial to a tight pair of strides. While David Beckham rarely gets it wrong these days when it comes to fashion, he is definitely also a fan of a tight suit, and arguably carries it off to perfection. What do the fashionistas make of the super-snug suit? Fashion blogger Simon Glazin isn't convinced by the current trend. He told FEMAIL: 'Over the last couple of years, terms like 'super skinny' and 'ultra skinny' have been adopted by menswear retailers when it comes to suiting, and to be quite honest, they scare me.' 'There's the circulation-restricting connotations the words 'ultra skinny' bring with them but also the simple truth that a too-tight suit can be quite hideous to look at.' Men are in danger of going for a debonair look but can end up revealing way too much, he adds. 'You don't want to show the world everything you've got! 'Some things should remain, erm, under wraps. You find bigger men stuffing themselves into these skinny suits, and the results are disastrous. 'As male models get thinner, so do suit cuts, but this is NOT representative of this country. Us men with 'real' bodies need suits that don't feel restricting. And don't restrict blood flow.' Who should you go for if you want comfort and style? 'Designer labels such as Versace and Salvatore Ferragamo offer suits that have a bit of breathing room.' Let's hope Pep, Dermot and Olly are reading.","Spanish football manager tore the side of his trousers exposing his thigh .

10305,ff49236f167909baa85ef33bb2097b361358f62d,"Ed Miliband's proposed change in the rules on 'non-doms' would cost Britain billions, experts warned last night. The Labour leader announced plans to overhaul Britain's non-domicile regime, which allows 116,000 foreigners and people with foreign links to pay tax only on money that they bring into Britain. Mr Miliband initially suggested he would 'abolish' non-dom status – but it later emerged that Labour is effectively proposing a time limit on it of between two and five years. Scroll down for video . Crowd-pleaser? Ed Miliband joins crowds in Warwick yesterday, where he announced his non-dom plans . The Tories pointed out that a five-year grace period would exempt up to six in every ten non-doms from the crackdown anyway, because many non-doms do not stay longer than five years. Announcing the policy, Labour aides suggested the change in the rules, which date back to the 18th century, would raise as much as £1billion. But tax advisers immediately disputed this, saying driving non-doms away would in fact cost the Treasury significant sums. With non-doms paying around £8billion in tax and national insurance a year, it is claimed that Labour's proposal could in fact create a huge hole in Treasury coffers. Within hours of announcing the policy, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was forced to admit he did not actually know how much extra cash the measure would raise. In a further embarrassment, it later emerged that just three months ago he himself had said such a move would be counter-productive – saying it would result in the country losing money. In a video that emerged yesterday, Mr Balls can be seen telling a local BBC radio station that abolishing the status altogether 'will probably end up costing Britain money because some people will leave the country'. Despite this, the surprise move by Labour wrongfooted the Conservatives, who took several hours to craft a coherent response. The issue of non-doms is a sensitive one for the Tories, because Mr Miliband has claimed David Cameron is close to 'dodgy donors', including non-doms, who support the party. Labour has repeatedly attempted to characterise the Tories as friends of the rich – despite official figures showing the best-off are paying more tax than they did under the last Labour government. Last night, sources close to Chancellor George Osborne indicated he would consider scrapping the right to pass on non-dom status to heirs. Last year, Mr Osborne announced a new £90,000 annual charge for people who are non-domiciled in the UK for tax purposes but have lived here for 17 of the past 20 years. Tory officials said it was more effective to hit non-doms with an annual levy than to 'tinker' with the status. The Chancellor said: 'Labour's policy is a total shambles. You have Ed Balls admitting it will cost Britain money and then when you look at the small print it turns out the majority of non-doms won't be affected.' In a speech at the University of Warwick, Mr Miliband insisted non-dom status was an 'arcane' rule dating back to the time of William Pitt the Younger, allowing a 'few people at the top' to 'operate under different rules'. 'There are people who live here in Britain like you and me, work here in Britain like you and me, are permanently settled here in Britain, like you and me, were brought up here, but just aren't required to pay taxes like you and me,' he said. Graham Aaronson QC, who chaired an independent committee which drew up new rules against tax avoidance, said the non-dom regime did need reform. He said he had advised the Treasury two years ago the right to pass it on to heirs should be scrapped, and suggested he also favoured removing the right for British citizens to claim it. But he was scathing about Labour's proposals, which he said would cost the country dear. 'It's either unbelievable deception or the man is completely pig ignorant,' he told the Daily Mail. 'I couldn't believe what I was listening to. This is why politicians have such a bad name. Mr Miliband was describing non-doms born here, brought up here, who go to school here, use our hospitals. The audience would have thought that's what a non-dom is. But it's a very small number. There are those that live abroad, their main family life, home and base but they choose to live in the UK for a month and a half a year. They pay taxes when they're here, they may employ people. It's ridiculous to treat them the same way.' Jolyon Maugham, the QC who advised Labour on its plans for reform, conceded the policy could lead to a flight of wealthy taxpayers from Britain. Yet the Labour supporter was cited by both Mr Miliband and Mr Balls as an independent expert who supports the policy. The QC, who admitted the Tories have a 'terrific record' on squeezing tax dodging, said his own calculations suggested the measure was likely to raise about £1billion, but there was a risk of a 'negative tax yield'. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg defended the non-dom rule, saying it allowed people to come to Britain, some of whom were not 'massively rich'. Simon Walker, of the Institute of Directors, said: 'It's very unclear what additional revenue would be raised, but the UK's international reputation would be put at risk.' Nicholas Leeming, of estate agents Jackson-Stops, said: 'The Labour Party is out to target the wealth creators in this country and will effectively close down London to international businesses and investors.'","Experts warn Ed Miliband's changes for non-doms would cost millions .

'The Rocket' is widely regarded as one of the most naturally talented players in history, although he has openly questioned his commitment to the sport during a career that has brought him five World Championship titles. Speaking to Forever Sports magazine, the world No 2 explained how his dedication can be personally tested by slow players, especially if he's feeling hungry.

'In snooker you have to sit in your chair and watch some f*****g numpty poncing about. Do you know what I mean? You just think to yourself: come on mate. But there's nothing I can do! I can stand up and go: 'look, boom boom boom' but the ref will say: ''sit down Mr O'Sullivan, it's not your shot. Just chill out, man. Wait until he's finished.'' I'm thinking: finished? I wanna get some dinner in. 'Oh s**t mate. They put me on an evening match and I've got some geezer poncing about, I think: I aint gonna get no dinner. Because of him!

8790,eaf4a7864208468af3cdc858185b807d54110e95,"(CNN)Five young Chinese feminists, whose detention has provoked an international outcry, may face up to five years in prison over their campaign for gender equality. The women were among detained on March 6 and March 7 in three Chinese cities -- Beijing, Guangzhou and Hangzhou -- shortly before events they had planned for International Women's Day on March 8. Wang Qiushi, the lawyer for one of the women, Wei Tingting, said police had recommended on April 6 that prosecutors press charges of ""assembling a crowd to disturb public order."" Wang told CNN that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by Monday. ""We hope that the prosecutors will not approve a formal arrest warrant, following the laws and standing up to pressure,"" he said. ""But nobody knows what to expect till Monday; we can do nothing but wait."" The five were initially held on suspicion of ""picking quarrels and provoking trouble."" Wang said he didn't know why the charge against the women changed. ""Neither should constitute a crime,"" he said. Campaign group Amnesty International said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum jail term of five years. ""The women were doing nothing wrong, nothing illegal. They were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment,"" William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International told CNN. ""Everything they were doing was in line with China's own laws and policies."" Wang said that Wei had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on March 31. Two of the women are said to be in poor health. He added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for International Women's Day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence and for more public toilets for women. The five -- who are members of China's Women's Rights Action Group -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying ""stop sexual harassment, let us stay safe"" and ""go police, go arrest those who committed sexual harassment!"" on women's day. The detention of Wei, along with Wu Rongrong, Li Tingting, Wang Man and Zheng Churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community. Protests have taken place in several cities, including Hong Kong, that urge Chinese officials to ""free the five."" A social media campaign also uses the phrase as a hashtag. On Monday, Hillary Clinton, former U.S. secretary of state, tweeted that the activists' detention was ""inexcusable."" Her comment drew a rebuke from Chinese authorities, who said public figures should respect China's sovereignty and independence. Maya Wang, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the activists were best known for their ""performance art"" style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women's restrooms, donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women. ""These activists epitomize the spirit of the times. They are young, confident, ready to challenge established norms,"" Wang said. As China prepares to mark the anniversary of landmark UN Fourth World Conference on Women in September, it will be hard for authorities to justify detaining the activists, she added.","Five young women have been detained by China since early March .
They campaigned against sexual harassment .
Their detention has attracted international criticism ."
2952,b6cbe954698fbbae809fe1abc80205068aa0bf9f,"An exotic bird in Brazil was recorded making incredible sounds that wouldn’t be out of place on a video game. The Curl-crested Jay, which resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre, is native to South America and is known to be a good mimic of other birds and man-made sounds. With the ever-growing presence of human’s in their natural habitats, the bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song. Videoed behind a fence, the bird initially makes a sinister noise like a distorted voice before creating an almost digital sound. Following this the bird makes a noise that sounds like running water before a Space Invaders style tune emerges from it. Discussing the video, companion parrot behavioural expert Greg Glendell spoke with MailOnline about the various theories regarding the function of these sounds. The Curl-crested Jay is native to South America and resides at the Criadouro Onca Pintada breeding centre . ‘Several groups of birds have a lifelong ability to learn to reproduce new sounds; notably parrots, starlings and crows,’ said Mr Glendell. The particular Jay belongs to the Crow/Corvidae family. ‘Some birds may use them to impress a mate or their peers within their flock,’ he added. ‘Most birds using mimicry are highly social species, with a complex vocal repertoire, which includes innate calls and learnt calls. The bird is one example of a number of species that have learned to incorporate peculiar everyday sounds into their song . ‘As social species they use their calls as language. There are often regional dialects within bird groups. So the same species shows differences in its calls across its range.’ Mr Glendell also noted that sometimes captive birds confined to cages use their ability to mimic to relieve their boredom and ensure responses from their owners. The original video was uploaded to YouTube account: Swiatoczamigoski by a Polish-based blogger who has spent some time volunteering at the Brazilian breeding centre.

The temperature had climbed above 40C for a whole week and even the Aussies were struggling. Appropriately, friends took us out that evening to dine in one of the city's hottest restaurants - Celsius! Luckily, it was air-conditioned and served phenomenal food. We especially appreciated the peanut butter and popcorn ice cream. But Adelaide that week was also hot for other reasons. It was the cycling mecca of the world, with 20 teams of Lycra-clad pros and their supporters tearing up the roads and hanging out in coffee bars.

The Tour Down Under is a big part of the international cycling season and contributes more to the South Australian economy than the F1 Grand Prix (formerly Adelaide-based, now in Melbourne) ever did. Not only was the launch night atmosphere electric, but it was great to catch up with our pals Sir Chris Hoy and Team Sky's Geraint Thomas. We also rubbed shoulders with the Indian cricket team. Howzat! We were staying at the Adina Apartment Hotel, the former Treasury building, where the old tunnels and cabinet rooms can still be seen. The Beatles hid here to evade fans back in 1964. Breakfast was served in the lovely oasis of the serene central courtyard, a delightful start to the day. The hotel is conveniently just round the corner from the splendid Central Market. A trip here is enough to convince anyone that Adelaide is the true food capital of Australia. And bearing in mind that some of the best wine is made within an hour's drive of the city, from the Barossa Valley to McLaren Vale, you feel very indulged. Adelaide is a much softer city than Sydney. It has charm, colonial history, sophistication and space to breathe. It's not called the City of Roses for nothing - there are lots of perfumed parks as well as wide boulevards.

Most beaches are half an hour away, but being creatures of habit, we always head for the Adelaide Hills and the foodie haven of Hahndorf. Here we lunch on superb venison pasta and salted caramel crepes at a quaint old cottage called The White House. We then do a bit of wine-tasting in the scenic Hills and lovely McLaren Vale, arriving at the classy Currant Shed in time for supper. Set in a lime grove and bordered by vineyards, this is my husband's favourite restaurant in the world. I've had a thing about cycling the Clare Valley Riesling Trail for some time. Indeed, part of the reason for coming to sunny South Australia was to tick it off my bucket list. So early one morning we drove 90 minutes north of Adelaide, picked up our bikes from Riesling Trail Bike Hire and cycled along a 15-mile-long disused railway, snaking past vineyards and cellar doors. The gradients were gentle, the information boards fascinating and the tongue-tingling rieslings superb. We then treated ourselves to lunch at Skillogalee Winery, sat under a beautiful old olive tree and overlooking valleys lined with vines. The historic town of Hahndorf, settled by Germans near Adelaide, is a true blue foodie haven . The bright green of the vineyards of McLaren Vale, a popular wine regions close to Adelaide . North of Clare is where the Outback truly begins. And that's where we were heading - to the rugged Flinders Ranges mountains. It took three hours to drive to the majestic range, the largest in South Australia. The Flinders have a stark beauty - the light on the rocks, the vegetation, the bouncing kangaroos, all make you feel as if you're a million miles from civilisation. We stayed at Arkaba Station, a 60,000-acre sheep ranch, from where we did incredible guided walks, taking in the sights, sounds and smells of this astounding wild terrain. If you want to do the Flinders in understated luxury, this is the way to do it.

Having travelled on the glorious Ghan from Darwin to Adelaide last year, and enjoyed every magical minute, he was determined to travel on its sister train, the Indian Pacific, from Adelaide to Perth. Frankly, I can't think of any better way of seeing Australia. You are treated like royalty, the food is outstanding and the huge views of this beautiful, baked continent are breathtaking. Two nights of cruising overland in air-conditioned splendour - it worked for me! As did the stop-offs, first at the Outback ghost town of Cook and finally at floodlit Kalgoorlie, the biggest open-cast gold mine in the country. The size and scale of the Super Pit and machinery were mindblowing. The same goes for the Nullarbor Plain which has hardly changed in millions of years. We crossed it on the longest stretch of straight rail track on earth - 297 miles without a hint of a curve. We arrived at the Indian Pacific terminal in Perth as fresh as daisies, and drove the three hours to Margaret River without stopping. But this is where we realised we'd made a big mistake. This was our first visit to Western Australia and to tag it on to the end of our holiday just did not do the region justice. The unique mining town of Kalgoorlie is  home to Australia's biggest over-cast gold mine . Sister train of the north to south Ghan, the Indian Pacific takes passengers from Adelaide to Perth . From the first step we took on the Cape to Cape Explorer walk with our guide we knew we'd found exactly what we wanted. The landscape spelt out AUSTRALIA. The views of turquoise bays and stretches of white sand, dotted with surfers, were postcard-perfect. Behind the beautiful Margaret River coastline, there are mysterious forests and caves. There's even a lighthouse where two mighty oceans meet. And then there are vineyards... In less than 50 years, Margaret River has become one of the world's greatest wine regions, gaining accolades galore for its cabernet sauvignons and chardonnays. Not only are you spoilt for choice for wines, but the food is up there with the best. Stand-out meals were the amazing breakfast at the luxury boutique hotel Cape Lodge, the special lunch hosted by the owners of Leeuwin Estate and the dreamy duck curry in the beautiful setting of Aravina Estate. The stunning coastline of the Margaret River, which is also one of the world's great wine regions . A special lunch was enjoyed with the owners of Leeuwin Estate in the revered Margaret River region . And how about sipping world famous Cullen red wine at the cellar door in the evening sunshine? This is the stuff memories are made of. We fell in love with Margaret River. Our last two nights were spent in a gorgeous villa at Injidup Spa Retreat, a peaceful paradise overlooking the Indian Ocean. It was such a stunning spot, and we were so relaxed after our massages, that we did not want to go out for dinner. Instead, we ordered hampers of local food from Lamonts Deli, along with bars of the local Bahen & Co Almond & Sea Salt chocolate, and ate splendidly at sunset on our terrace. We toasted the sun, sand and surf and vowed to come back.

2184,ed2dbe0f8a7fc8ea761c4df1d2ecd23d571a8e1c,"(CNN)There is a special kind of hell reserved for the women who fall into the clutches of today's Jihadi fighters. We are all familiar with the brutality of ISIS, the self-anointed Islamic State, or Boko Haram, the Nigerian terrorists who have pledged allegiance to ISIS. This new wave of violent Islamist groups proudly brandishes medieval methods of cruelty through modern technology as a tool of recruitment and intimidation. But there is something very different about the way they treat women. The jihadi chiefs have a strategy beyond the battlefield. Their treatment of their female victims plays an important part in their ambitious radical strategy. Killing the enemy, the men, is a tactic for winning battles and conquering territory. What they do to women has an altogether different purpose: It is part of the larger plan of building a ""caliphate,"" a Sharia-ruled state complete with controls and norms harking back to the seventh century or, rather, to the group's interpretation of life in the early days of Islam. Yazidi girls who slipped ISIS after its siege of Mount Sinjar describe how they were sent to slave warehouses along with hundreds of other women. There, they were lined up in groups of 50 and displayed for ISIS fighters to choose among them, some for marriage, others for sexual slavery. The stories told to journalists or to human rights workers are confirmed by doctors who have examined the girls and say they have found evidence of repeated sexual assault. An investigation by Human Rights Watch found  ""a system of organized rape and sexual assault, sexual slavery, and forced marriage by ISIS forces,"" actions that the group says ""are war crimes and may be crimes against humanity."" In Nigeria, Boko Haram also has a very specific approach to women. The 276 students kidnapped one year ago make up a small portion of the 2,000 women and girls kidnapped by the group since 2014, according to  Amnesty International. There, too, women captives move from house to house and village to village, forced to convert when they are not Muslim, and prepare for marriage to jihadis. It's a stark change from the previous generation of jihadis, when Osama bin Laden headed al Qaeda. Women were not a big part of al Qaeda's immediate plans because al Qaeda, unlike ISIS, viewed the establishment of a caliphate as a distant goal, one for future generations. In contrast, ISIS is actively engaged in building those social structures. And if you want to build a new society, you need more than soldiers. You also need women. Women are indispensable for establishing a functioning community, even one whose laws are brutally repressive. Even if women are viewed as the property of men, they are still needed, not just for cooking, cleaning and sex, but to keep the home and raise children; hence the methodical capture, assault and subjugation. It is no accident that Boko Haram has targeted students, as it did in Chibok, or that Somalia's Al-Shabaab Islamists killed scores of women in the massacre at Kenya's Garissa University in Kenya. As in previous conflicts, women are spoils of war and rape is a weapon of war. It is a way to humiliate the enemy, a ""reward"" for soldiers and a tactic of ethnic cleansing. During the Bosnian war of the 1990s, experts said Serbian soldiers engaged in systematic rape, thinking the babies of raped Bosnian Muslim women would be Serbian. In Darfur, government-backed militias were accused of using mass rape to humiliate the non-Arab groups. But this is different. The women are not simply abused and discarded. ISIS and Boko Haram are enslaving them and incorporating them into the daily life of territories they rule, subjecting them to asphyxiating restrictions and abuses that have caused many of them to attempt suicide, according to some of those who escaped -- a phenomenon reminiscent of Afghanistan during the rule of the Taliban, another radical Islamic group that managed to take control and impose unspeakable rules for women. ISIS is going to great lengths to prove how its treatment of women, including the selling of Yazidi prisoners as slaves, is in keeping with Islamic law. Its online magazine cites Islamic writings proclaiming: ""We will conquer your Rome, break your crosses, and enslave your women, by the permission of Allah."" The worst fate is reserved for non-Muslims, such as Yazidis, but Muslim women in areas seized by Islamists have seen disaster. From Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, a modern town until ISIS conquered it last year, women say, ""They have withheld all freedoms from us"" and describe oppressive, fear-filled lives. The brutality of the new jihadis is more than mere sadism. If it is madness, it is madness with a method. And when it comes to women, the method is one that aims to control them as a way to establish the society they envision, one where some women say life is simply not worth living.","Frida Ghitis: ISIS and other jihadi groups see women as crucial in role of caliphate they want to create .

8976,2fb0ce2745464acf117efd7eb77f7feb0693e788,"Like super-models, they follow a strict daily diet — in their case, three carrots, an apple and a few cabbage leaves — to keep in shape for their public appearances. Over recent months, they have been feted across the globe and pampered wherever they go. One is even going to have a song written about his life. But when I meet Darius — the biggest rabbit on earth — and his similarly sized son, there is little evidence of diva behaviour. Former Playboy model Annette Edwards holds her world record Continental Giant rabbit Darius aloft . Five-year-old Darius is 4ft long and weighs just under 3st — the king of the Continental Giant breed. He is the size of an average eight-year-old child. Slightly wary, I join him on the floor of his owner's home in the Worcestershire village of Stoulton and find he is a thoroughly gentle soul. He sits quietly, as I stroke his ultra-soft, grey fur, and examine his outsized ears and paws. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff. Aged only one, Jeff is already 3ft 8in long and weighs 2st. With a rabbit's peak weight and length kicking in at the age of two, Jeff has got some way to go. 'He's going to get bigger,' says their owner, Annette Edwards. 'His length is amazing. I think he might well take Darius's record.' Annette, a former Playboy model (not a Bunny Girl, it must be noted!), is a genius at giant rabbit-breeding. She has held the record for the world's biggest rabbit, with different animals, since 2008. It would be no surprise if Jeff took the title off his dad: after all, Darius took it from his own mother, Alice. Darius seems nonchalant about his world record — and untroubled that he is set to lose his title to his son, Jeff . Annette, who has owned 100 bunnies over the past ten years, says the art of giant rabbit-breeding is simple. 'It's the same as humans,' she says. 'Some breeders make the mistake of only having one big parent. Both parents have got to be big. Jeff's mum, Sally, is 3ft 5in long. She's one of mine, too.' The crucial thing is that rabbits from the same family shouldn't interbreed. 'You mustn't,' Annette stresses. 'You end up with all sorts of illnesses, and overgrown teeth.' Unsurprisingly, nutritious food is at the heart of giant rabbit- breeding, and Annette admits that Darius is 'very greedy'. As well as those daily carrots, apples and cabbage leaves, her brood have a bale of fresh hay a week between them. But, even with these hearty appetites, rabbit-breeding is a cheap hobby: £10 a week in grub for both bunnies. And medical care isn't expensive, either. 'They don't need much looking after,' Annette says. 'Only vaccinations against myxomatosis, and solutions to get rid of fly eggs.' Certainly, Darius — recently given a clean bill of health by vets — seems to be in very good condition, as well as being intensely relaxed. It's only when I boldly try to pick him up — it's like lifting a hefty toddler — that he struggles a bit. Apparently, he's a little shy of strangers but very affectionate once you get to know him. 'Darius has more experience with people,' says Annette. 'But he's a little slower. He plods around and follows me more. Jeff follows in his footsteps but he's more energetic because he's younger.' Annette is currently single but insists that sharing her home with giant rabbits hasn't affected her love life. 'No one has ever minded them,' she says, 'I'd only be with someone who likes animals.' She is clearly devoted to the rabbits and looks after them with great attention. 'A lot of giants only live until the age of five. But mine live to eight to ten.' On the sad day that they die, Annette's beloved bunnies are buried in the garden under a rose tree. This devotion to animals began in her childhood. 'I was an only child brought up by my grandmother,' says Annette, who herself is a grandmother of 14 and a mother of ten. 'I had a couple of rabbits as pets. I adored them — they were my little friends.' Giant genes: Jeff and his giant father Darius - who currently holds the record for being the world's largest rabbit . Annette had to put rabbits to one side when she embarked on a modelling career. She was Miss Birmingham at the age of 29, as well as the Face of Nivea and a Page 3 Girl. She still models — 'mostly magazine work' — and, three years ago, at the age of 60, she was the Sun's oldest ever Page 3 Girl. Her work took her around the world, including New York, where she appeared as a model in Playboy magazine. As her children started to grow up, Annette returned to her love of rabbits. A friend put her in touch with a rabbit dealer in Holland, where the Continental Giant comes from. In 2004, she bought Amy and Roberto — they were unrelated, so she could breed them. 'My family were a bit shocked — they thought they were the size of dogs! But I loved that they were so big, so gentle and loving — and very different.' At that stage, Annette had no intention of going for any records. But, after an article on her rabbits appeared in the local paper, she was asked if she had considered applying to the Guinness Book of Records. Like all world records, measurement had to be precise to the last millimetre and gram. To judge their body length, they had to be laid out and measured from front paw to back paw, with legs fully extended. And so it was, in 2008, that Annette learned that 3ft 3in long Amy was a world record holder. Annette has held the record for owner of the world's biggest rabbit ever since. Not surprisingly in this age of bizarre hobbies and record-collecting, there's keen competition — and Darius is insured 'for a lot of money'. Is his title under threat? Annette says: 'No one's come close so far.' Of course, I bet you are asking yourself whether what they say about the rampant breeding habits of rabbits is actually true. Well, the answer is: yes. Rabbits, giant or otherwise — left to their own devices — can produce 60 young a year. Competition: Darius the rabbit measures 4ft 4in long while 3ft 8in Jeff still has six months of growing to do . 'That's cruel — it would kill the mothers in the end,' says Annette. 'So I keep them to two litters a year, each of around four or five rabbits. 'It's important to keep them relaxed. When it's warm outside, they like to lie under a tree in the garden. But in cold weather I keep them indoors [in large dog crates] — although it's the damp you should be more worried about — it gets into their bones.' Annette says her rabbits are easy to have about her home. They roam around the kitchen, garden and a small barn. They don't have access to the rest of the house, although she sometimes takes them into the sitting room, wrapped in a blanket. The rabbits cost £500 a time for personal appearances and have regularly appeared on television — including the Paul O'Grady Show. A musician has asked if he can write a song in Darius's honour, and their record-breaking has featured in news bulletins all over the world. Still, the Kardashians of the rabbit world have kept their cool, and not given in to any of the wicked temptations of global celebrity. Whether Darius retains his title or his son succeeds him, you just know that there will be no bad blood between the two most famous rabbits in the universe.","Annette Edwards has owned more than 100 bunnies in the past 10 years .

6739,7042c7a5408a40aa9eb7825374d1f77675c2c4f1,"(CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin shrugged off repeated questions about the impact of Western sanctions on his nation during a nationally broadcast annual Q&A session. ""Sanctions are sanctions,"" he said. ""As far as sanctions are concerned .... (they're) about the need to constrain our development,"" not just about Ukraine and Crimea. Western sanctions were implemented after Moscow annexed Crimea and pro-Russian separatists battled Ukrainian government forces in the nation's east. Putin predicted the sanctions would not end soon. On the Middle East, the Russian leader defended lifting a ban on the sale of a sophisticated air defense system to Iran. ""We need to encourage our Iranian partners,"" Putin said, referring to a preliminary deal to limit Iran's nuclear program. Sanctions against Iran have had a dramatic impact on the nation's economy. On Israeli and Western fears that such a system would embolden Iran, Putin scoffed. ""Iran is not a threat to Israel at all,"" he said. ""It is a defense weapon."" Putin's annual exercise is fascinating for ordinary Russians, who normally get him in closely managed doses on state-run television. These sessions are live and can go on and on. Last year, he spoke for three hours and 55 minutes. In 2013, it was a record-setting four hours and 47 minutes. Organizers said public interest was especially strong this year, with 2.4 million questions submitted. Of course, critics of the Kremlin slam the entire event as Russia's imitation of democracy in action. It's hard to imagine a truly critical question, they say, getting aired on national television there. In fact, it's best not to look at this event as an opportunity for Russians to question their leader at all. Instead, it is more like a highly produced, highly choreographed chance for their leader to speak to them, and to the world. Last year, there was a ""surprise"" appearance by NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, who was granted asylum in Russia. He addressed Putin by video link, quizzing Putin about Moscow's own surveillance practices.","Putin has spent hours fielding questions from the general public on live television .

8203,82c05b926165cfc302e92585060b061d0c46a294,"(CNN)If I had to describe the U.S.-Iranian relationship in one word it would be ""overmatched."" We're playing checkers on the Middle East game board and Tehran's playing three-dimensional chess. Iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices, all the while convincing ourselves that America's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track. Iran isn't 10 feet tall in this region, but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end-all that is supposed to reduce Iran's power, the United States is only making Tehran taller. Consider the following: . The U.S.-Iranian relationship is not symmetrical. It's not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors. Iran is about to try a U.S. citizen and Washington Post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest, we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from Iran's serial abuse of human rights, including  the behavior of its Shia militias in Iraq. I can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behind-the-scenes plan to have Iran release Jason Rezaian. If not, we're legitimizing a bad regime and compromising U.S. values and interests  in the process by not ensuring that all Americans being held by Iran come out as part of the nuclear deal. America is alienating some of our closest allies because of the Iran deal, and Iran is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see Iran's power rising. Our friends aren't perfect, particularly the Saudis and even the Israelis. But we need them precisely because Iran is rising. Sadly, the administration is sending signals that cutting a deal on the nuclear issue takes precedence over their priorities. In the meantime, Iran's allies, Bashar al-Assad's Syria, Hezbollah and now the Houthis -- not proxies, but instruments of convenience -- see what's happening and are willing to play and cooperate even more in the Iranian game. The Russians, too, realize that the nuclear issue gives them cover to sell sophisticated missile defense systems and soon to export even more to gain influence and hard currency. We're  losing friends; Iran is gaining them. And in one of the cruelest ironies, Iran's way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah: the nuclear issue. As the Arab world melts down and lacks a traditional epicenter of strength and power, (Egypt, Iraq, Syria), Iran is rising. The argument here is not that Iran is taking over the Middle East. But in its zone of influence, a zone critical to the United States -- Syria, Iraq, the Gulf, Yemen, Lebanon -- it is expanding its influence, not contracting. Washington doesn't play this kind of game well. It is tripping all over itself trying to figure out how to combat ISIS in Syria and yet not empower al-Assad (no answer), how to combat ISIS in Iraq without favoring the Shia-dominated government and alienating Iraqi Sunnis (no answer)and how to backstop the Saudis in Yemen without enabling them to make matters worse through their airstrikes (no answer). Iran has a much easier time managing contradictions. Indeed, it can use the threat of ISIS to keep the Americans away from weakening their ally al-Assad as well as expand its influence in Iraq under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest. Battle group naval assets to the Gulf of Aden notwithstanding, the United States is being outfoxed, not outgunned. Don't expect U.S. ships to stop those of Iran. As State Department spokesperson Marie Harf said, ""There are reports about these U.S. ships that have been moved and I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression. They are not there to intercept Iranian ships. The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe. I think there was some misreporting and confusion on this. I just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those Iranian ships."" It clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain Iran's nuclear program. But we should have no illusions about two things. First, we won't end Teheran's nuclear weapons pretensions, and two, we are and will be enabling its rise in the region because of this nuclear diplomacy, not constraining it.  One of the reasons the United States won't strike al-Assad is for fear of emboldening ISIS, but the other is that we don't want a proxy war with Iran in Syria. As the Russians have made clear in their recent S-300 deal, the nuclear negotiations are only making Iran a more acceptable business partner. And the real fruits of the diplomacy haven't even begun yet. Sanctions relief will make the mullahs more secure and give them the resources to buck up, not tamp down, their regional aspirations. We've made our bed, apparently, and now are going to have to find a way to sleep. A nuclear deal will avert a crisis over the nuclear issue for now. But unless it really does change Iran's behavior, we've only bought ourselves a bigger one down the road.","Miller: While the U.S. entangles itself in the nuclear negotiations, Iran is gaining a freer hand to assert its regional influence .

8114,560833702b373c238eae1bc1468d1d789cbbd6b7,"An astonishing letter from the Titanic's owners to the family of a dead officer asking for a huge sum of money to return his dead body to England has been uncovered 103 years on from the tragedy. The letter, dated May 7, 1912, was sent from White Star Lines to Christopher Moody, the brother of 24-year-old officer James Moody, who died after the Titanic hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage. In it, company bosses demand £20 - the equivalent of £2,000 in today's money - to return his body to England, and state that Christopher Moody will have to pick up the tab from there. Scroll down for video . Bosses from Ismay Imrie & Co, co-owners of White Star Lines, wrote this letter to the family of officer James Moody who died on board the Titanic, telling them his body could be returned - but only for a price . The letter asks for £20, almost £2,000 in today's money, to have Mr Moody's remains sent to his home in Scarborough, and say it will be the family's job to pay for him to be transported to the morgue and for burial . The letter, from bosses at Ismay Imrie & Co, the parent company of White Star Line, read: 'We have your further letter of the 6th instant, and while we will be prepared to transport the remains of your brother across the Atlantic to either Liverpool or Southampton we regret that it is not possible for us to do any more. 'Should you after further consideration desire the remains of your Brother to be returned will you kindly telegraph us in the morning at the same time sending us a deposit of £20 for any expenses and land charges on the other Side and we will at once cable New York asking then to arrange this if practicable. James Moody was born in Scarborough in 1887, the son of John Henry Moody, a twon councillor, and Evelyn Louise Lammin. Privately schooled, he was sent away to King Edward VII Nautical School in London where he graduated with a masters in 1911. He went straight into service as an officer, first working on the Titanic's sister ship the Oceanic, before transferring to her ill-fated relative in 1912, then aged 24. Serving as the vessel's sixth junior officer, he set sail on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on April 14, 1912, along with 2,224 passengers and crew. Two days later, as the boat was passing through the northern Atlantic, Moody was on night watch when he received a call from one of the lookouts at 11.40pm. 'What do you see?' Moody asked. The man replied: 'Iceberg, right ahead!' After the collision, Moody was seen on deck all night, helping passengers into the lifeboats, and declining to go himself, despite all his junior officer colleagues escaping. He was last seen shortly before 2.20am, when the boat finally slipped under, still trying to launch more lifeboats. Today there is a memorial to him in Scarborough, with the inscription: 'Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.' 'We also think it right to point out that the arrangements and expenses for taking charge of the remains after arrival of the steamer at Liverpool or Southampton would be on your account.' Instead, the company suggests that Mr Moody's remains be buried in Halifax with the other survivors, but they offer to send his family 'a photograph of the tombstone', if they want one. Even more shocking is the fact that Mr Moody's body had not been recovered by the time the letter was sent, and bosses would have known that, as all remains were cataloged. The remains of Mr Moody, who was on watch when the ship struck the iceberg and later helped passengers into the lifeboats while declining a space for himself, have never been found. Mr Moody was among the 1,500 passengers and crew to die aboard the Titanic when it sank in the north Atlantic on April 14 1912, two days into her maiden voyage. He had been serving as the Titanic's sixth officer, and was the only junior officer to perish after staying behind to help evacuate the passengers after the other officers left. Born in Scarborough in 1887 to John Henry Moody, a town councillor, and Evelyn Louise Lammin, James was privately educated before being sent to King Edward VII Nautical School in London. He passed his masters exams there in 1911 before becoming an officer. He was originally stationed on the Oceanic, the Titanic's sister ship, but transferred just months before the disaster in 1912. The letter has come to light after being listed for auction by a collector who acquired it directly from Moody's family. Experts at Henry Aldridge and Son of Devizes, Wiltshire, have described the two-page letter as 'beyond comprehension' and say it could make £25,000 when it goes under the hammer. Mr Moody (front left), 24, was the Titanic's sixth officer, and the only junior officer to die on board while helping passengers into the lifeboats, long after his colleagues had abandoned ship . The Titanic (pictured), sank on April 14, 1912, on her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York, after colliding with an iceberg in the northern Atlantic . Andrew Aldridge, from the auctioneers, said: 'White Star Line is asking for £20, which was a colossal amount of money in 1912, for the return of the body of one of their own officers. 'The mere concept of requiring payment for the return of the body of anyone who died on Titanic - let alone one of the ship's officers - is just beyond comprehension. 'It is an horrific act on the part of White Star. You can't imagine how Christopher Moody must have felt to have been greeted with a letter like this when he was grieving for the loss of his brother. 'What's more, the £20 White Star were asking for did not cover getting the body home or to the undertakers once it arrived in England. 'But where this letter is most shocking is the fact that Moody's body had not been - and never was - recovered in the aftermath. 'When this letter was sent the recovery ships had already arrived in New York and the bodies they had found had been identified and catalogued. 'You would like to think the sending of this letter was an administrative error but it's open to a lot of interpretation. 'The implications are huge - how many families of the deceased did White Star ask for payment from? 'James Moody was an incredibly brave man, helping to get passengers into liferafts and choosing to stay with the ship until the bitter end. 'It appears that White Star treated his body as a commodity, which callous in the extreme.' RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK to New York City, US. More than 1,500 people died when the ship sank carrying 2,224 passengers and crew under the command of Edward Smith. Some of the wealthiest people in the world were onboard the ship, including property tycoon John Jacob Astor IV, great grandson of John Jacob Astor, founder of the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Millionaire Benjamin Guggenheim, heir to his family’s mining business, also perished, along with Isidor Straus, the German-born co-owner of Mancy's department store. The ship was the largest afloat at the time and was designed in such a way that it was meant to be 'unsinkable'. It had an on-board gym, libraries, pool as well as several restaurants and luxury first class cabins. There were not enough lifeboats on board for all the passengers due to out-of-date maritime safety regulations. After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912, Titanic called at Cherbourg in France and Queenstown in Ireland before heading to New York. On 14 April 1912, four days into the crossing she hit an iceberg at 11:40pm ship's time. James Moody was on night watch when the collision happened, and took the call from the watchman, asking him 'what do you see?', the man responded: 'Iceberg, dead ahead.' By 2.20am, with hundreds of people still on board, the ship plunged beneath the waves, taking many, including Moody, with it. Despite repeated distress calls being sent out, and flares launched from the decks, the first ship arrived nearly two hours later, pulling 710 people from the water. It was not until 73 years later that the wreck of the ship was discovered on the ocean floor.","James Moody, 24, officer on the Titanic, died helping passengers escape .

As people clamor to find out about this humble champ from Texas, a letter penned six years ago when he was still in high school has surfaced which only reinforces his nice guy image. As a junior at Jesuit High School in Dallas, the grateful golfer wrote the letter to the Murphy family who had funded the scholarship that helped pay for his tuition. Scroll down for video . A letter of thanks penned by Masters champion Jordan Spieth six years ago when he was on a scholarship at Jesuit High School in Dallas, left, has surfaced which only reinforces his nice guy image . As a junior at Jesuit High School in Dallas, the PGA golfer was humble enough to write the letter to the Murphy family who funded the scholarship that helped pay for his tuition . In the thank you note, Spieth wrote that he earned the scholarship from a work grant program, reports The Dallas Morning News. Spieth, already dreaming about winning the Masters, was already an extremely talented golfer in 2009 and he casually informs the family that he's the No. 1 junior golfer in the country. The 21-year-old impressed many following Sunday's big victory with his manners and affable manor as well as his golfing skills. As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends.

Another legend impressed by Spieth was Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: 'Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. 'Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He's polite, he's humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he's obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.' The one family member who wasn't present to enjoy the celebrations was Jordan's 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. The siblings regularly Facetime each other and every time they talk Ellie asks he brother if he has won yet. 'I'll finally be able to tell her yes,' he said, smiling.

In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: 'I don't see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,' it does not come across as at all boastful.

4209,4797cb97383e989c7540e0dca72d0ab0070ef2fd,"With a sting like a hot nail being hammered into the body, Asian hornets have killed at least six people in France. Now experts fear millions of them could be heading for Britain – and the threats they pose are to be discussed at a summit meeting by beekeepers. This is because the two-inch-long Asian hornets pose a terrible danger to our honeybees. They pick off bees as they leave their hive until the colony is so exhausted the hornets can move in and ransack it. Scroll down for video . Sting in the tail? Experts fear millions of two-inch-long Asian hornets (above) could be heading to Britain after leaving six people dead and terrorising wildlife in France . The hornet is thought to have travelled to France on some Chinese pot plants in 2004. It has colonised huge swathes of the country and, with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in just a couple of hours, honey production has plummeted. The Norfolk Beekeepers' Association will hold its Bee Health Seminar at Easton and Otley College on May 23, organised in conjunction with the National Bee Unit, which delivers the Bee Health Programmes on behalf of Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Topics under discussion will also highly infectious diseases which threaten bee colonies such as European and American foulbrood. Carolyne Liston, chairman of the Norfolk Beekeepers' Association, warned Asian hornets are a 'very, very aggressive predator' and said they could 'come here on the wind'. She said: 'They can absolutely decimate colonies and we are concerned that it is going to come in on someone's caravan who has been travelling in France.' UK beekeepers have been sent email alerts by Defra asking them to be on the look-out for the menaces. Danger: The threats posed by Asian hornets are to be discussed at a summit meeting by beekeepers, while UK beekeepers have been sent email alerts by Defra asking them to be on the look-out . The Asian hornet can measure up to  2in long with a 3in wingspan – slightly smaller than the European hornet but much more aggressive. One Asian hornet can kill 40 bees in a minute, while a handful can destroy a hive of 30,000 bees in a couple of hours. They build rugby ball-shaped nests in trees, housing some 500 hornets. They scare off intruders by sending a lone worker hornet to 'warn' them – if that fails, the workers attack en masse. Worker hornets have lifespans of 30-55 days. Asian hornets have a black head with an orange-yellow face and bright yellow leg tips, while the European hornet has a copper coloured head with a bright-yellow face and entirely reddish-brown legs. They have been urged not to approach nests, which they say hornets make in tall trees or in garages and sheds. If Asian hornets are spotted here, the National Bee Unit will send out experts from the Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency to kill them using special chemicals. Ministers drew up battle plans in case killer Asian hornets are discovered in Britain last year. A law announced in the Queen's Speech gave officials powers to enter private land and destroy new invasive species within days. Groups of Asian hornets hover in front of a beehive, picking off single honeybees, decapitating them and stripping off their wings and legs before making off with the 'meat ball' to feed their young. In Asia, honeybees have learned to encircle an intruder hornet and, by flapping their wings, cause it to overheat and die. But the French bees have not had enough time to evolve an effective tactic. The hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans but, like bee stings, it is likely to kill only if the victim has a severe allergic reaction. The victims in France died from anaphylactic shock after being stung. Last night, a Defra spokesman confirmed there had been no sightings of Asian hornets in the UK so far.","Millions of Asian hornets have colonised swathes of French countryside .

Indianara Carvalho, 23 - who had hymen surgery last year to 'restore' her virginity so she could enjoy her first time all over again with ‘someone special' - accompanied the racy photo with the phrase: 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength.' The image, just one of a series of nude body-painted shots she shared over the Easter weekend, attracted more than 750 'likes', as well as a tirade of disapproval from her followers over its sacrilegious nature. Scroll down for video . Sacrilegious? Indianara Carvalho, 23, accompanied the racy image (pictured) with the phrase, 'Good Friday. Lord, on this day I ask for peace, love, wisdom and strength' 'Don’t mix God with your ridiculous shame and profanity,' wrote one Instagram user, Eliane Paz Salinas, of the portraits, which were created by Brazilian artist Binho over a marathon ten-hour spray can session. Another, Cadmo Barrera Lerma, ranted: 'You have lost my total respect, at least one in your list of followers.' Janvier Veliz Angulo concurred, stating: 'This proves that beauty is not everything … you have lost me as one of your fans.' Referring to Miss Carvalho's accompanying prayer, another user fumed: 'I think that to ask for peace and love and protection there is no need to be naked!!!! Please respect things related to God!'

Miss Carvalho's lengthy prayer also stated: 'Father, protect my ears from all evils and watch my steps on the path to truth. 'May your blessings fill my spirit and my heart, which is so kind and cheerful... Feel your sweet and gentle presence... I am your grace.' The buxom blonde triumphed in Brazil's annual bottom beauty contest last year, which sees 27 women - one from each state - complete to prove their backside is best. Shortly afterwards, she underwent 'vaginal rejuvenation surgery' which includes a hymenoplasty, in order to bring 'respect' to her BumBum title, and to use her newly virginal status to find love. Christianity is the dominant religion in Brazil, with Roman Catholics accounting for 64 per cent of the population and Protestants making up 22 per cent, according to the latest Census . Miss Carvalho, pictured mid-workout, said last year that by re-becoming a virgin, she hopes to bring 'a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss BumBum title' The procedure, which is not available in the UK, can be done by using surgical gel to create a new hymen that lasts a few days before dissolving, or more permanently by using a flap of skin cut from the vaginal wall. Women undergoing the latter treatment must abstain from sex for at least three months after undergoing the procedure. According to the New York Daily News, Miss Carvalho said: 'I wanted to undergo surgery to reconstruct my virginity before I have new photographs done. 'I wouldn't feel good about appearing naked if I wasn't exactly as I came into the world if you know what I mean. 'I think I also want to give a bit of respect and new concept to the Miss BumBum title by being a virgin.'

2742,583a3dbf84d843e6295f9c50f357075a717821ed,"Is this the world’s safest bike? Its designers certainly think so. Boasting front and rear lights, rear view mirrors and even a car horn, the team behind the electric Babel Bike say it is unprecedented in its approach to safety. And perhaps most noticeable of all is the roll cage that surrounds the cyclist - keeping them safe against trucks and buses turning into them. Scroll down for video . London-based designer claims to have made the world's safest bike. Called the Babel Bike it has a host of features including a roll cage. Crispin Sinclair (shown with the bike) is seeking £50,000 of funding on site Indiegogo. The bike also has foot protectors and an electric motor . The Babel Bike was designed by London-based Crispin Sinclair - son of the famous British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, whose 1985 Sinclair C5 bike turned out to be somewhat of a flop. Crispin will be hoping a similar fate does not befall his invention though - and hopes the array of safety features will appeal to safety-conscious cyclists. He is seeking £50,000 ($74,000) of funding on Indiegogo to bring his dream to fruition. The price might be a bit much for some, with the non-electric version retailing for £2,499 ($3,693), and the full electric version £3,499 ($5,170). Both are £500 ($740) less if bought through Indiegogo. May 2016 is the estimated delivery date for the bike at the moment. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike’s innards. It doesn’t rely on pedal power alone, but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the US and 15.5mph in the EU. ‘In both the US and the EU you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor can’t assist at higher speeds (by law),’ the team notes on their Indiegogo page. The bike has a small wheel at the front and a larger one on the back, with a lockable white bar connecting them that doubles as storage for the bike’s innards . There is a holder for a smartphone on the front so you can keep track of vital stats . The controls for the Shimano 250-watt electric assist motor are located on the handlebars, and provide up to 50 per cent assistance. The battery has a range of 50 to 80 miles (80 to 130km). The bike is recharged by either removing the battery and recharging it at home, or with an optional electric-car-charging lead. At the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors, which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock. The Babel Bike was designed by London-based Crispin Sinclair - son of the famous British inventor Sir Clive Sinclair, whose 1985 Sinclair C5 bike (pictured with Clive in it) turned out to be somewhat of a flop . At the front of the bike are two steel foot protectors, pictured here, which are detachable and can also be used as a bike lock . The bike doesn’t rely on pedal power alone, but rather has an electric motor inside that assists it at speeds of up to 20mph in the US and 15.5mph in the EU. ‘In both the US and the EU you can still pedal faster but in both jurisdictions the motor can’t assist at higher speeds (by law),’ the team notes on their Indiegogo page . But Crispin notes in a video that even all these safety features ‘won’t help in a collision with a turning bus or truck at a junction - by far the single biggest cause of cycling fatalities.’ Transport for London says that 65 per cent of all bike fatalities in London are caused by trucks and buses cutting across cyclists. So the team designed a roll cage for the bike, which prevents it getting trapped under a vehicle. If a truck or bus comes into contact with the bike, it will hit the roll cage first and ensure the cyclist is pushed to relative safety – or at least, that’s the plan. The side of the seat – also detachable – has foam pads to cushion against side impacts, while the shape has apparently being designed with aerodynamics in mind by former Red Bull F1 engineers. ‘Our dream is to put a million more cyclists on our roads, and therefore take a million cars off them, and to do that we need to give cyclists their safety back,’ said Crispin. Whether the bike will prove to be more of a success than his father’s invention remains to be seen, though.","London-based designer claims to have made the world's safest bike .

Getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level. Alaska Airlines Flight 448 was just barely on its way to Los Angeles from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on Monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold. ""There could be a person in there so we're going to come back around,"" he told air traffic control. The banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from Menzies Aviation, a contractor for Alaska Airlines that handles loading the luggage, the airline said.  The man told authorities he had fallen asleep. It appears he was never in any danger. The cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled, the airline said. The plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes. The passengers knew something wasn't right, almost as soon as the plane took off. ""All of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear,"" Robert Higgins told CNN affiliate KABC. The pounding grew louder. ""At that point, we started hearing yelling, screams for help, very, very faint,"" Jamie Davis said.  ""That's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us."" As the banging continued, a federal air marshal sprang into action. ""At some point, the marshal kind of made himself known,"" said Troi Ge.  ""He started banging back, and he yelled really loud and said, 'We're getting ready to land, hold on to something.'"" The emergency landing spooked the folks aboard Flight 448. Affiliate KOMO spoke to Marty Collins, another one of the passengers. ""We just took off for L.A. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we'd land within five to seven minutes, and we did,"" Collins said. ""When we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane."" ""I think it's scary and really unsafe, too,"" Chelsie Nieto told affiliate KCPQ. ""Because what if it's someone who could have been a terrorist?"" The ramp agent appeared to be in OK after the ordeal. He was taken to an area hospital as a precaution, the airline said. He passed a drug test and was discharged. The employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m., just before the flight departed. ""During a pre-departure huddle, the team lead noticed the employee was missing. The team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee's cell phone, but did not receive an answer. His co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home,"" the airline's blog said. Alaska Airlines said it's investigating.  The man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight. All ramp employees have security badges, and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired, according to the airline. After the delay, the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to Los Angeles early Monday evening. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Ramp agent tells authorities he fell asleep in cargo hold, Alaska Airlines says .

So many to choose from but given Augusta’s predilection for a tale of redemption — from Vijay ‘kiss my ass’ Singh to Adam ‘this one’s for you, Greg’ Scott — let’s go for the reformed party animal Dustin Johnson. Time for him to prove he can match his gargantuan yardage off the tee with the requisite amount of brain cells. Dustin Johnson watches his tee shot during a practice round on the Augusta course on Wednesday . Best European (Non-UK) Not so many to choose from, alas. Indeed, given Henrik Stenson spent a week in bed with flu recently and reckons his strength is still low, we’re almost empty-handed. Still, let’s hope the Swede can rise from his sick bed. Other than that, it’s time Victor Dubuisson returned to the limelight. Henrik Stenson has only recently recovered from flu but the Swede will be hoping to mount a serious challenge . Best from the UK . Let’s leave out the history man on the grounds he has his own category. Lee Westwood has got an impressive recent record at Augusta and Justin Rose has shown he can play well here. But I have a feeling Paul Casey is the most likely to join Rory and get into contention come Sunday afternoon. Best International . You can hardly have faith in Adam Scott to emulate Bubba Watson and win a second Masters in three years given he’s confused enough on the greens to be going back to the long putter. While Scott sorts himself out, compatriot Jason Day has an outstanding chance to grab another win for Australia. Jason Day has a great chance to become another Australian winner at the Masters . Best each way bet . When you think last year’s joint runner-up Jonas Blixt is 150-1, there are some tasty odds out there. How about Padraig Harrington at 80-1? Or Bernhard Langer to finish in the top six at 400-1? My particular favourite is three-time Masters champ Phil Mickelson at 25-1. A steal. Phil Mickelson watches his fairway shot on the 11th green during his practice round on Wednesday . How will Rory do?

Rory McIlroy will begin his quest for a Grand Slam when the Masters kicks into action on Thursday . How will Tiger do? Not as good as some American writers believe, who are fitting him up for his fifth green jacket already on the strength of shooting 33 for the front nine on a practice round on Monday. Not as bad as the doomsayers think either, though. He should make the halfway cut… and maybe scrape into the top 20. Prediction: 19th .

Just a day after William's parents made an impassioned plea for the three-year-old to be returned to them, police have described the 'fast-paced' investigation into the new line of inquiry. 'The two worlds collided. We have information that could link William’s disappearance to a group of people suspected of paedophile activity,' said lead investigator Detective Inspector Gary Jubelin. Scroll down for video . The parents of missing William Tyrrell, who police now say may have been kidnapped by a paedophile ring, have revealed the moment they realised their son was missing . The focus of the investigation has shifted dramatically, and is now 'progressing rapidly', according to Homicide Squad commander Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, reported news.com.au. 'We are pursuing many, many lines of inquiry but what I can say is that there is a team of detectives working very hard. This is a very fast-paced moving inquiry,' Detective Superintendent Willing said. The Detective Sup took a firm stance on the consequences for anyone found to be involved with the toddler's disappearance. 'If you know anything you are implicated. If you are involved you will be charged,' he said. Det Sup Willing also spoke of the heartache William's parents had experienced since his abduction, and said that the family needed answers to where their beloved little boy was. This comes as the three-year-old's mother spoke out about the horrifying moment she realised her son had vanished. Little William's mother frantically searched the house, opening cupboards and yelling out, 'You need to talk to mummy and tell me where you are' in the moments after she found she couldn't hear her son. 'When I realised that William was missing – I think back to that moment where I just went, ""I can't hear him, why, why can't I hear him"",' she said. William had been in the front yard of his grandmother's house in Kendall, on the NSW mid-north coast, when he disappeared in September last year. 'I just walked out and just I see nothing, I hear nothing, I'm speechless. I'm walking around in a circle on the spot thinking where is he? Why can't I see him? And I'm yelling out, ""William, where are you""?' his mother told The Sydney Morning Herald. The toddlers parents released a heart-wrenching video earlier on Friday begging for his return. 'Just give him back ... take him to a church, take him to a police station, take him to school. Give him to someone, give him back,' his mother says in a video released by police. William's father choked back tears as he remembered his son, who was infatuated with the Spider-Man superhero. '(He loved) anything that related to Spider-Man and superheroes,' William's father said in the video. 'He's a cheeky, vibrant little boy ... full of energy. I mean he's my little boy.' One of the new photos released by police of William Tyrrell show the three-year-old smiling and playing guitar, while other images and photos show an energetic and happy youngster full of life . Heartfelt plea: William Tyrrell's distraught parents released a video pleading for their missing son's return as well as home movies showing the lively boy riding his bike (pictured) and playing at the family home . But he said William was a cautious boy who wouldn't go with a stranger. His mother said she had a vision that somebody 'reached over ... has gone `clump' on his shoulders, picked him up and moved him on ... because ... that's the only way ... to explain for him not to be there.' She said the family was struggling with not knowing where William is or what happened to him. 'We need to know what happened to him ... `cause we can't live forever ... like this.' She said she hoped whoever had him was looking after him. 'I want him to be safe, I want him to be feeling loved and I want someone to be looking after him because to imagine that something else is going on ... we can't live like that.' The distraught couple has also released new pictures and home videos of the boy in the hope that new clues will emerge as to his whereabouts. In the videos, William can be seen riding his bike down a path and flashing a cheeky grin, as well as playing a guitar and swivelling his hips in times to the music. 'Just give him back':  The parents (pictured) issued the plea in an emotional video released by NSW Police to encourage people to come with forward with new leads as to the missing toddler's whereabouts . Full of life: The new videos of William Tyrrell (pictured, above at a slightly younger age) show a smiling boy full of energy and his mother has begged kidnappers to show her son care and love if the little boy is still alive, seven months after police believe he was abducted from his grandmother's NSW mid north coast home . The parents of missing three-year-old William Tyrrell have released new pictures of their son and a video pleading for his return by abductors who are believed to have snatched him in daylight last September . Legal restrictions have prevented William's parents from speaking publicly throughout the ordeal, and their identities are not revealed in the video. The footage comes as detectives reveal that they believe the three-year-old may have been abducted by a paedophile ring. Detective Superintendent Mick Willing, NSW Homicide Squad Commander, said on Friday: 'One of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring.' He said detectives from the homicide squad and the sex crime squad are 'vigorously perusing that line of inquiry and this investigation is moving at a very fast pace.' 'We are persuing every lead that we get,' Detective Willing said. William was last seen dressed in a Spider-Man suit and playing in his grandmother's yard in broad daylight in a quiet street in Kendall last September. Vigorous pursuit: NSW Homicide squad boss Detective Superintendent Mick Willing (pictured) revealed on Friday that police are investigating William Tyrrell's disappearance at a very fast pace and that 'one of our lines of inquiry relates to people we expect to be involved in a paedophile ring' A new home video of cheeky William Tyrrell (pictured, eating cake) has been provided by the family in their desperate wait for the return of the three-year-old, seven months after his probable kidnap . Investigators believe he was snatched during a very short window of time when he was out of sight of his family as he played outside. The parents are calling for any who has any information to contact Crime Stoppers immediately on 1800 333 000. The release of the video comes more than a month since police scoured bushland in Bonny Hills, south of Port Macquarie, for evidence relating to William's whereabouts. Police divers were brought in from Sydney to search a murky dam in a bush reserve and a nearby swamp, after more than 30 officers and the dog squad had spent spent two days searching through dense bushland - including along a track that can only be accessed by four-wheel drive. The three-day search was carried out near local washing machine repairman William 'Bill' Spedding's home. Mr Spedding was identified as a person of interest in the case after he was due to fix William's grandmother's washing machine around the time the toddler vanished. However, Mr Spedding says he didn't go to the house on September 12 because he couldn't get in contact with William's grandmother. Police searched the 63-year-old's home and business in nearby Laurieton in January, seizing various items, including cars, a mattress and computer, for forensic examination. Mr Spedding has strongly denied any involvement and police have previously stressed he isn't their only line of inquiry.

Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as ‘fuel’ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. Research led by the University of Montana has found that eating fast food (stock image shown) after a workout may be just as beneficial as dietary supplements. Researchers found that during recovery periods between periods of exercise, it didn’t matter what food was eaten . The research, published in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism, was led by University of Montana graduate student Michael Cramer. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. After this, half were fed hot cakes, hash browns and orange juice, followed by a burger, fries and a Coke two hours later. If you fancy a burger, then sprint to the fast-food joint to get it. Short bursts of intensive exercise before a high-fat meal can help protect blood vessels from the effects of a poor diet, researchers have found. Just eight minutes of high-intensity cycling was found to be more beneficial than going at a moderate pace for 25 minutes - the current recommended level. Scientists at the University of Exeter say the short burst approach may be more appealing to youngsters - few of whom achieve even the minimum of an hour of moderate exercise a day. The other group were given Gatorade, organic peanut butter and Cliff Shot Bloks, followed two hours later by Cytomax powder and PowerBar products. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles (20km) on a stationary bike a fast as they good. Each meal eaten by the participants was roughly equal in calories, carbohydrates and protein - although the fast food had more sodium and slightly more fat. At various intervals, the researchers took muscule tissue samples and did blood tests, to check glycogen levels. After a week, the participants returned and performed the task again, this time switching their diet to the one they didn’t do last time. The results showed that, when performing the second exercise task, the times were about the same no matter which meal group the participants were in. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements. Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . Also, levels of glycogen across the two groups were almost the same - with the fast food group being slightly higher. No differences in insulin, glucose or cholesterol were found, while neither group reported any serious stomach discomfort. ‘These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,’ the researchers wrote. However, the researchers said that the experiment included a fairly small sample, and the long-term effects on workout recovery of eating fast food over other, healthier sources of food are not known.","University of Montana student studied recoveries after a workout .

Mandy Dunford, 54, was followed around her farm in the North Yorkshire Moors by 67-year-old Kenneth Ward, naked apart from socks and boots. The military historian even performed sex acts in front of her. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. Farmer Mandy Dunford, 54 (right), feels forced to leave her home after neighbour Kenneth Ward, 67 (left), who was jailed for exposing himself to her in 2011, was released from prison and allowed to return to his home . Police had discovered of a cache of weapons, including machine guns, in his home. A judge at Teesside Crown Court also imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, banning the flasher from being within 200 metres of Miss Dunford. But while the former police officer believed her nine-year ordeal of harassment was over, Ward has now been released – and has successfully appealed to have the restraining order overturned. It means he will be able to return to his cottage next door to Miss Dunford’s farm in Chop Gate, North Yorkshire. As a result, she said she feels forced to leave. ‘I feel yet again that the offender has been given more rights than the victim,’ the farmer said. ‘My punishment for his crimes has been far worse than anything he has ever faced – I’m losing my home so that he can return to his … I expected to live here for the rest of my life with my animals around me.’ In a hearing held since Ward’s sentencing, a new boundary was drawn up allowing him to approach Miss Dunford’s farm from all sides. She added: ‘It means he can follow me around with only the width of a wire fence between us. ‘When I heard the order had been changed … I was horrified and I knew my only option was to pack up and leave. I will be forced to abandon my home and my life just so that he can return … I can’t see the justice in that and I want to know why the rights of a man who tortured me for so long are more important than mine.’ Miss Dunford’s problems with Ward began when she put a gate across a lane shared by their properties. Ward was jailed for five years in 2011 at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) after admitting 11 counts of exposure and numerous firearms offences. However, he has now been released and allowed to return home . She said: ‘He first started exposing himself to me around 2002 and would peer in through my windows with his wild staring eyes. ‘He’d run around the house at night shouting and tapping on the windows … he’d come right up to me and follow me around wearing nothing but boots and socks. ‘Sometimes he’d climb a ladder and expose himself over the wall of his cottage and once he confronted me on the lane and aimed a rifle at me. I turned and ran and heard five shots go off … I went to the police to report him but their response was hopeless.’ Ward and his brother also left piles of maggot-infested animal carcasses outside her home. Police finally arrested him after Miss Dunford filmed the harassment and showed them hours of footage.","Mandy Dunford forced out of home after neighbour exposed himself to her .

2932,345b67d97bee64c2f7eba138a611ce98a2123c20,"The UK is to open its first three proton beam therapy centres after cancer-stricken five-year-old Ashya King made a miracle recovery after receiving the treatment. Cardiff-based Proton Partners International Ltd, is to open the treatment centres, which will be available to NHS cancer patients, in Cardiff, London and Northumberland by 2017, with the first in the Welsh capital being operational by next year. The announcement comes just weeks after the parents of brain cancer sufferer Ashya told of how he was given the 'all-clear' after receiving proton bean therapy at a centre in Prague. Scroll down for video . Five-year-old Ashya King, pictured in October, who suffered from brain cancer but has recently been given the all-clear after receiving proton beam therapy . Three centres in the UK in Cardiff, London and Northumberland, are set to open offering proton beam therapy, which Ashya, pictured, received . Both Brett and Naghmeh King sparked an international manhunt last year after taking their son out of hospital in Southampton, without doctors' consent. Mr and Mrs King had wanted their son to have the cutting-edge therapy instead of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fearing that Ashya would be taken away from them and given the treatment, the family fled to Spain before travelling to the Czech Republic to the Proton Therapy Centre. Now, a group called Proton Partners International has now been formed in the UK following discussions between Professor Sir Chris Evans, the life sciences entrepreneur and UK life sciences and healthcare investors. They have committed almost £100million equity finance into the company. Professor Gordon McVie, senior consultant at the European Institute of Oncology, has been appointed chairman of the group, and Professor Karol Sikora has agreed to become chief medical adviser to the company, alongside a range of renowned cancer and healthcare experts. Ashya, with his parents Brett and Naghmeh. The Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment . Professor McVie said: 'This is an exciting and important development of the provision of cancer treatment in the UK. As things stand, patients who benefit from this treatment have to go abroad for treatment, often at great expense to the NHS. 'The creation of these centres will go a long way to ensuring the very best of treatment is available in the UK.' While Sir Chris added: 'We are delighted that the UK's first centre will be based in Cardiff and Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund is proud to support this breakthrough. While conventional radiotherapy uses high energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells, often damaging surrounding tissue, proton beam therapy aims radiation directly at the tumour. Because it is so highly targeted it means it can avoid healthy tissue, particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour. While radiotherapy can lead to side effects such as nausea and can sometimes disrupt how some organs function, proton beam therapy has a lower risk of side effects. This means it is effective for treating cancer that affects critical areas, such as brain cancer. However, Cancer Research UK estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long-term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known. The only proton beam facility currently in operation is at the Clatterbridge Centre for Cancer NHS Foundation Trust in the Wirral, Merseyside, which delivers 'low energy' therapy for rare cancers around the eye. The NHS currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the United States for treatment. They must be assessed by a panel who may decide patients are not suitable if there is unlikely to be a clinical benefit from the treatment. More than 400 patients have been sent abroad since 2008 - most of these children - at an average cost of £100,000 per patient. 'There are more than 150,000 people treated for cancer each year in the UK and the demand for treatment is growing. 'It is anticipated that NHS demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017. Proton Partners will be able to play a leading part in helping meet demand in the UK as of next year.' In addition to state of the art Proton Partners' treatment services, the Cardiff centre will provide conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy and supportive care. Proton beam therapy is a highly-targeted type of radiotherapy that can treat hard-to-reach cancers, such as spinal tumours, with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects. The Government has announced that it is to create two NHS proton beam therapy units which will open in 2018. The Kings faced every parent's worst nightmare when their young son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. But the family's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal NHS radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities. And despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy, the Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. They were arrested by European authorities and banned from seeing their sick son, with a High Court judge only approving the move to Prague after they had been released. When he finally arrived at the centre in September last year, Ashya was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes. But in October, he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras, thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in Malaga, Spain, and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother Naveed. Since then, he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life. However, despite the treatment and his recovery, Ashya's parents say they fear their children will be taken into care if they return to the UK, his grandmother said last month.","The three centres are planned for Cardiff, London and Northumberland .

3403,7344a9b120b339c394c3f905cbc1097096de9b2e,"The pursuit of journalists for paying public officials was in ruins last night after prosecutors dropped a raft of cases. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories . Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the £20million ‘politically-motivated witch hunt’ turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists – Operation Elveden – was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said ‘enough is enough’, adding: ‘It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.’ The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty . Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain’s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers’ cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office – under which prosecutions were brought – had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists – news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt – still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials – including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff – charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday’s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was ‘remarkable’ that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: ‘Enough is enough.’ The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured ‘two years of torture’. He added: ‘I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It’s a disgraceful waste of public money.’ The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was ‘inevitable’ and left prosecutors with a ‘duty’ to act.

7067,f09d8039938bef571d8110ceaf46cb0ebba1639f,"Britain's intelligence agencies have been ordered to destroy information they got illegally by spying on confidential communications between a Libyan dissident and his lawyers, a watchdog has ruled. GCHQ, the Government’s listening post, unlawfully intercepted telephone calls and emails from Sami al-Saadi – even though the legally-privileged material was protected by strict rules. In a landmark ruling yesterday, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) the only judicial body with the power to investigate the security services, ordered spies to destroy two copies of the sensitive eavesdropped communications. Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham. The Government’s listening post unlawfully intercepted telephone calls and emails from Sami al-Saadi, it has been ruled . GCHQ confessed it intercepted confidential conversations between Mr al-Saadi (pictured) and his lawyer . Mr al-Saadi has fought a legal battle against the British Government claiming it was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to his homeland to be tortured by the Gaddafi regime. But the IPT said the dissident should not receive compensation for breaching Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the right to private and family life. Intelligence chiefs sparked fury in February by admitting that they had unlawfully listened in to lawyer-client communications even though they are generally covered by 'legal professional privilege' to protect privacy and the right to a free trial. Now GCHQ has confessed it intercepted confidential conversations between Mr al-Saadi and his lawyer. The IPT rejected similar claims by other Libyan claimants including Abdel Hakim Belhadj, another prominent anti-Gaddafi campaigner. Britain has already paid Mr al-Saadi £2.2million compensation after he took legal action over MI6's role in his abduction, imprisonment and mistreatment by Libya. Mr Belhadj is currently suing the UK. It has not been disclosed what type of material the two documents contained or when they were recorded but they are likely to be transcripts of telephone conversations secretly intercepted by GCHQ. Last night Mr al-Saadi said: ‘I had always been told I had a right to communicate with my lawyers about this torture case in private, but that clearly wasn’t the case. Tony Blair with former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Mr al-Saadi has fought a legal battle against the British Government claiming it was complicit in kidnapping him and sending him back to his homeland to be tortured by the Gaddafi regime . ‘This was illegal behaviour and I hope now that the right to take legal advice in private will never be ignored again.’ Richard Stein, his solicitor, said: ‘GCHQ unlawfully spied on privileged legal communications for years, and the secret oversight mechanisms failed to stop it. ‘This marks the end of GCHQ’s standard boilerplate response that its activities are lawful, necessary and proportionate. I am sure that the unlawful behaviour we have uncovered in this case is the tip of the iceberg.’ Cori Crider, of legal charity Reprieve, which represented the families, said: ‘GCHQ spied on privileged legal communications, in a case where they were being sued by a rendition and torture victim. ‘We are pleased that one man has finally beaten the security services in this secretive tribunal. But this kind of illegal snooping makes phone hacking look like child’s play, because it rigs the whole justice game in the government’s favour.’ The IPT's ruling said that two documents involving al-Saadi ‘contained material subject to the legal professional privilege… held by GCHQ’. It added: ‘In order to emphasise the importance of the protection of legally privileged material the tribunal has required GCHQ to give an undertaking that the parts of the documents containing legally privileged information will be destroyed or deleted so as to render such information inaccessible to the agency in the future.’ The IPT rejected similar claims to Mr al Saadi's made by other Libyan claimants, including Abdel Hakim Belhadj (pictured), another prominent anti-Gaddafi campaigner . Mr al Saadi was kidnapped with his family in Hong Kong in 2004, and tortured after his rendition to Libya following what he claims was a tip-off by MI6. He was eventually freed and returned to Britain where he began legal action against the Government. In December 2012 Britain agreed to pay Mr al Saadi £2 million in compensation in an out of court settlement. However, the Government did not admit liability for the rendition to Libya in 2004, nor confirm that MI6 was involved. Mr Belhadj is currently suing the UK over the same scandal. He insists he was tortured during six horrific years in jail, including being beaten and hung from hooks on the walls. The former Islamist rebel, now a prominent politician in Tripoli, has spurned a seven-figure settlement and wants an admission of guilt and an apology from Britain. Last October, the Court of Appeal heard claims that the British Government under Tony Blair was complicit in the arrest of Mr Belhadj and his wife at Bangkok airport in 2004. His legal battle raises the extraordinary prospect of Mr Straw and Sir Mark Allen, a former senior MI6 spy, being hauled before the courts to give evidence. A Government spokesman said: ‘We welcome the tribunal's confirmation today that the intelligence agencies did not seek or gain any advantage in legal proceedings and, in fact, held no information referring to any legal advice relating to the claimants.’","Sami al-Saadi's  communications with his lawyer were illegally intercepted .

On Wednesday, he was tentatively approaching the young bull elephant in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley when the animal charged, and knelt on Gibson until he died. Crushed to death: Ian Gibson, 55, was killed by a young bull elephant while measuring its ivory for a U.S. client . His American client, who was also present, has not been identified. The Dallas Safari Club is paying for Gibson's funeral. Despite only having one leg, Gibson was described by fans as 'fit and strong'. According to a statement from Safari Classics, posted on AfricaHunting.com, the group had stopped for a rest when the animal approached their group. Gibson and his tracker approached to assess its ivory. 'At very close range, Ian was able to get off one shot before the bull killed him. The scene was very graphic,' the statement read. Twitter users were widely pitiless, with hundreds of animal rights supporters commenting that he 'got what he deserved'. Lauded figure: Gibson, who lived in South Africa, was a popular figure in the U.S. safari enthusiast community . Backlash: Twitter users have been widely unsympathetic to Gibson's death in Zimbabwe on Wednesday . Tributes posted on the hunting forum slammed unsympathetic reactions to Gibson's death, describing the big game hunter as a 'magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist.' According to friends, he fired one shot at the young bull elephant, who was going through 'musth' - a period of high testosterone. The animal then charged. Gibson's trackers wrote on AfricaHunting.com: 'We know 'Gibbo' shot it once, from about 10 yards away, with a 458 [rifle]. 'He would never have fired unless he had no alternative. He was a hunter, yes, but he was also a magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist. Prized: Ivory tusks are some of the most prized treasures hunters can get, enraging animal rights supporters . 'He was so experienced and this is a most unexpected tragedy.' The news has come a month after a study was released warning that ivory hunting is continuing to diminish the elephant population in Africa. A report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is known as CITES and regulates wildlife trade, said poaching rates of elephants in areas that are being monitored still exceed their natural birth rates. Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increases. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Prince William is one of the world's most prominent voices in defense of elephants against ivory hunters.","Ian Gibson, 55, was hunting in Zimbabwe for an American client .

City boss Manuel Pellegrini has been hampered over the past year by UEFA restricting them to a net transfer spend of £49million in each window and keeping the club’s overall wage bill to its current level of £205million-a-year. UEFA’s settlement with City published in May stated those penalties would remain in place until the end of the 2015/16 season but the club’s latest financial figures showed drastically-reduced losses of £23million which they feel proves they are now compliant with FPP regulations. Manuel Pellegrini is hoping that the financial restrictions imposed by UEFA for a breach of FFP rules will be lifted at the end of this season . Manchester City have been limited to a net spend of £49million in the last two transfer windows - they spent £25m bringing Wilfried Bony in from Swansea in January . Ahead of Monday night’s trip to Crystal Palace, Pellegrini was certainly talking like a man excited at the prospect of signing 'crack' players this summer. ‘I think that next season we don’t have any restrictions so we will be in the same position that all the other English clubs have,’ said Pellegrini. ‘It’s important. You have so many strong teams here in England and in Champions League, you can not allow them to keep the advantage every year; having less players to put in your squad or spending less money. We spend money, of course we always spend money, but they spent more.’ Manchester United, Barcelona, Liverpool and Arsenal have all paid more in transfer fees in the past 12 months than City who were traditionally Europe’s biggest spenders after the club was taken over by Abu Dhabi owners in 2008. Uefa also ordered City to play with a reduced squad from 25 players to 21 in the Champions League this season and while that restriction has now ended, any time reduction in the penalties on spending and wages is more controversial. Arsenal have paid more in transfer fees than City in the last 12 months, including £30m on Alexis Sanchez . The document published last May by UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body investigative chamber explicitly said City’s financial penalties would run for two seasons at least and there has been no official deviation from that decision. The published statement said at the time: ‘Manchester City agrees to significantly limit spending in the transfer market for the seasons 2014/15 and 2015/16. It means City will have to argue their case with Uefa that as they have been financially compliant over the past year, they deserve to be free of restrictions moving forward. They have successfully argued their case with UEFA before. Last summer they persuaded the governing body to allow them to bypass the normal quota of eight homegrown players as their Champions League squad had been reduced. Eliaquim Mangala joined the champions from Porto for £32m last summer . The reigning Premier League champions have only paid money for Fernando, Willie Caballero, Eliaquim Mangala and Wilfried Bony in the last two transfer windows and that was part-paid by the sales of Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell. Pellegrini admitted they weren’t in a position to compete with neighbours United for established world stars like Angel di Maria because of the FFP penalties. It has cost City on the pitch. Even if they win their remaining eight Premier League fixtures their points tally will be lower than last season and they crashed out once again at the last-16 stage of the Champions League. Pellegrini and director of football Txiki Begiristain both accept the squad needs replenishing and they want to be in the market for the top available players. Manchester City have been heavily linked with a move for former Chelsea midfielder Kevin de Bruyne . The club also want to be involved in any race for Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling . They have been strongly linked with former Chelsea winger Kevin de Bruyne who has been one of the best players in the Bundesliga with Wolfsburg. And if Liverpool do allow Sterling to leave, City want to be involved in the chase for one of England’s most outstanding talents to help fit in with quotas for homegrown players. ‘If you are the manager or a player of a big tem, you are always open to criticism because everyone expects a high level of performance,’ he said. ‘The major issue with our team always seems to be the money but this season I think we were the team that spent less than any other team. That is the weird thing. ‘For this club trying to be a big team in so few years, maybe we are paying the cost for that.’ Since the transfer penalties were introduced, City have spent £91million on players in the last two windows (Net spend £68million). That compares to Manchester United £145.5million, Liverpool £113million, Arsenal £92.5million and Chelsea £82.6million. Over the same time period Barcelona spent £118.3million on players and Real Madrid £81.2million though they also broke the world transfer record for Gareth Bale the previous summer.","Manchester City have been restricted to a net transfer spend of £49m .

251,5ff090272dfda8385b1a95a80ea3f2f88ee28df6,"Tents crushed by snow, belongings strewn across the mountainside and a desperate scramble to find any injured victims: this is the chaotic scene after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake sparked an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing 18 people. Before and after images show how the wave of snow, ice and rock flattened the usually serene 18,000-foot-altitude base camp on Saturday. The avalanche started on Mount Kumori, a 23,000-foot-high mountain just a few miles from Everest, and gathered strength as it tore across the world's highest peak. Half an hour after the initial quake, another magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit, followed by smaller aftershocks across the region. Eighteen people died in the avalanche, including four Americans, and 61 were injured, according to Nepal's mountaineering department. Scroll down for videos . Covered: An image, left, shows Everest Base Camp as it usually looks in April compared to how the same place looked following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake on Saturday. Survivors have recalled how they felt themselves being dragged by the wind and snow and emerged to find the camp destroyed . Before the storm: The snow-covered scenes are in start contrast to how the base camp (seen in 2013) usually looks at this time of year . Flattened: But on Saturday, an avalanche pummeled the campers at the 18,000-foot-altitude base camp, leaving it covered with snow . American Google executive Dan Fredinburg, 33, was the first confirmed fatality on the mountain. New Jersey-born Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, was also killed by the avalanche where she worked as a medic for Madison Mountaineering. A third American, Tom Taplin, 61, who owned TET Films & Photography, was making a documentary when the earthquake hit, NBC News reported. His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. On Sunday the first survivors were flown off Everest by aid helicopters and began sharing their incredible stories of survival. Bhim Bahudar Khatri, a cook for a climbing team, said: 'I was cooking for my team in the meal tent when the earthquake hit. We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me. 'I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive. 'I dug a few more feet until I was out of the snow and could breathe. I looked around and saw the tents all torn, crushed and many people injured. I had lived, but lost many of my friends.' An Everest guide, Pemba Sherpa, 43, added: 'I was resting in my tent when the earthquake hit. I heard a big noise and the next thing I know I was swept away by the snow. I must have been swept almost 200 meters. I lost consciousness. Wreckage: People look over the scene on Saturday after the earthquake triggered the avalanche that flattened parts of the base camp . Deadly: An image from Sunday shows a tent completely flattened by the avalanche, which left 18 people dead on Saturday . Carried to safety: Rescuers use a makeshift stretcher to carry an injured person after the massive avalanche on Saturday . Changed landscape: Another photograph shows the base camp following the huge avalanche on Saturday . Fight for survival: One survivor recalled 'a huge wall of snow' falling on him and how he had to claw his way out to survival . Recovery: A group is seen carrying an injured climber in their sleeping bag; more than 60 people were injured in the incident . Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest . 'When I regained consciousness, I was in a tent surrounded by foreigners. I did not know what happened or where I was.' He said the toll on Everest was sure to rise: 'There are still many people who are still missing on the mountain. There were several tents buried by the snow, several blown away.' Michael Churton, a filmmaker from New York, was with four other colleagues at the base camp when the earthquake hit, and he said that it took about 45 seconds for the avalanche to finish. 'I told the group to get down,' he said. 'It was about 4,000 feet of snow just coming and there was nowhere to run.' After curling up into a fetal position, he was thrown into a rock, which left him with cuts to his face and a black eye - but he was otherwise uninjured. Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest. Speaking from his sleeping bag at base camp on the north side of the mountain, the experienced climber said his group took cover after rocks the size of cars came crashing down around them. 'At first we could feel the trembling under the tent, but it was eerie as there was no noise, it was silent. Then it felt like we were shaking on a huge plate of jelly,' he said. 'It was so strange feeling the ground turn to jelly under our feet and we thought the mountain would start crashing down on us.' The instructor from Adventure Peaks, who was leading a group of eight clients on their first trip up the mountain, said the area was badly hit by rock falls, but they all escaped injury. Killed: Three Americans died on the mountain: Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, (left), who was working as a medic at the time, Google exec Dan Fredinburg, 33, (center with his ex-girlfriend, actress Sophia Bush) and documentary filmmaker Tom Taplin, 61 (right) Heading out: Rescuers carry a sherpa injured by the avalanche. The quake is believed to have killed more than 4,000 people . Heading home: A rescue helicopter prepares to land on Sunday and the first survivors were carried off the mountainside . 'Sure enough, an area of steep cliffs did break off sending car sized boulders hurtling down only a few hundred metres from our tents. We are still feeling aftershocks hours later. 'We were very lucky as no one in our group has been injured, but one climber was struck by a boulder.' He said their main priority was now working out how to leave base camp and make their way home, as the road to Kathmandu has been obliterated by the quake. 'We are trapped and have nowhere to go, we can't get back to Kathmandu, the road has been completely destroyed and there is absolutely no way to get through.' Climber Garrett Madison, who runs Seattle-based firm Madison Mountaineering, described how he was leading his group up the mountain when he heard the terrifying sound of avalanches. 'We heard an awful noise and heard avalanches coming down either side of the valley,' he said. 'We thought we were going to get wiped out but we were only dusted by a snow cloud. We proceeded up to Camp Two and contacted Base Camp where we heard of the awful destruction.' On Monday, it emerged that the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 4,400 people, with more than 8,000 injured. The toll is expected to rise as assessments are made in vulnerable mountain villages that have been inaccessible since the quake. Nepalese officials have speculated that the number of casualties could reach as high as 10,000.","Photographs taken after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake sparked an avalanche on Mount Everest on Saturday show the campsite buried beneath snow and belongings strewn across the mountain .

Thousands of pounds of it. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. The mountain is part of the Himalaya mountain range on the border between Nepal and the Tibet region. The 34-member team plans to depart for Kathmandu on Saturday and start the ascent in mid-May. The upcoming trip marks the 50th anniversary of the first Indian team to scale Mount Everest. ""Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard,"" Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. ""We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit,"" said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. ""There are old cylinders, tents, tins, packets, equipment and other mountaineering waste. Apart from our own haversacks weighing 10 kg each, we intend to bring in another 10 kg each on the trip."" More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Indian expedition isn't the first attempt to clean up the trash left by generations of hikers. Among the cleanup efforts is the Eco Everest Expedition, an annual trip launched in 2008 that is all about climbing ""in an eco-sensitive manner,"" bringing old refuse, in addition to that generated during the trip, down for disposal, according to the Asian Trekking website. Last year, Nepalese tourism authorities started to require hikers to carry out an extra 18 pounds of garbage, in addition to their own trash and human waste, according to the New York Times.","Generations of Everest climbers have left tons of trash .

When the 43-year-old mother-of-one discussed an Australian father's tip for getting his baby to sleep less than a minute with her co-hosts on yesterday's show, she vowed to try the method, which involves gently gliding a piece of tissue papers over a baby's face until the tot nods off. But Savannah soon learned learned that the trick didn't have a calming effect on her energetic infant. 'Not only did it not make her quiet,' she revealed on the show this morning, 'It got her so excited she started screaming and squealing with joy.' All smiles: Savannah Guthrie's eight-month-old daughter Vale giggled with glee when her mom tried to get her to sleep using tissue paper . Savannah, who had the experiment filmed by the Today show cameras, showed a clip of baby Vale ready for bed in a light blue onesie printed with pink birds – but as soon as she started caressing her daughter's face with the tissue, the infant broke out into a wide smile. Vale was soon cooing and laughing with delight - but she wasn't any closer to going to sleep. Last month, Nathan Dailo, a father from Sydney, posted a video to his YouTube channel demonstrating how he gets his three-month-old son Seth to fall asleep in just 42 seconds with a single piece of white tissue paper. The clip of his son drifting off has since received more than 1.7 million views, with one mom commenting on Wednesday that the trick worked for her baby five times already. Full of energy: The 43-year-old watched as her daughter grabbed at the white tissue paper she was using to try and calm her down before bed . Looking confused: Vale, who wore light blue onesie with pink birds, stared at her mom, who was trying to get her ready for bed . Although the tip didn't quite work on Savannah's smiley daughter, she noted that Vale 'really loved it'. And the adorable footage was definitely worth watching. 'Could we cancel the rest of the show and watch this? Today show co-host Willie Geist asked of the precious video. Savannah also revealed that the trick wasn't a total failure in her home. Riled up: Savannah gently glided the tissue over Vale's face, but the trick didn't calm her down at all . Happy girl: Vale soon started laughing and squealing with delight . 'It worked on Mike [Feldman],' she said jokingly of her husband. 'He was out in 30 seconds.' Before they moved on to the next segment, Willie couldn't help but gush over Vale one last time, saying: 'She is the cutest.' In February, Savannah threw an impromptu party for her daughter live on air in celebration of baby Vale’s six-month birthday.

The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born from a  surrogate mother. Injaz was six years old this week and is said to have conceived naturally. The world’s first cloned camel is pregnant, scientists claim. The mother-to-be, whose name is Injaz, was cloned from the ovarian cells of a slaughtered camel in 2009 and born by surrogate mother. Injaz is pictured here when she was just six days old . Dr Nisar Wani, scientific director of the Reproductive Biotechnology Centre in Nad Al Sheba, Dubai, told The National: ‘We are very excited because Injaz is now pregnant and we expect to have a calf from her late this year. ‘She has conceived in a natural way. This will prove cloned camels are fertile and can reproduce the same as naturally produced camels.’ The birth of Injaz, whose name means 'achievement' in Arabic, caused great excitement in 2009 and scientists said that cloning would help to preserve the genetics of the camel population. Camels are a valuable commodity in the desert sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf, and are used for racing and transport. They can also produce low-fat milk and can make owners millions of dollars at camel beauty contests. Since Injaz was born, many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning, including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner. It's 19 years since the first mammal was cloned. Dolly the sheep (pictured) was born in Edinburgh using DNA from an adult cell . Since Injaz was born, many more animals have been produced by genetic cloning, including one from the cells of a camel beauty pageant winner, the BBC reported. It took five years of work before Injaz was cloned. She was born on April 8, 2009 weighing 66lbs (30kg), after an uncomplicated gestation of 378 days. The calf was created from cells harvested from the ovary of an adult camel. The cells were then planted into the egg of a surrogate mother. Injaz was confirmed as genetically identical to the camel the cells were taken from, according to United Arab Emirates newspapers at the time. The world's first mammal was cloned 19 years ago. Dolly the sheep was born in Edinburgh using DNA from an adult cell. Dolly was put down in 2003, after being diagnosed with lung disease, but since then, scientists have successfully cloned mice, cows, pigs and dogs as well as camels. Human embryos have been genetically modified so that any changes made will be carried on into future generations for the first time, according to scientists. Researchers around the world are bracing themselves for the results of a study by scientists in China that has introduced DNA changes to reproductive cells. Many scientists have already reacted with horror at the idea, for fear it could be misused to allow parents to 'select' the genes they will pass on to their grandchildren. Human embryos, like the one above, may have been genetically modified with new gene editing techniques . They say that even embryos created in this way for research purposes only could have serious ethical and safety implications. They have described it as 'dangerous and ethically unacceptable'. However, others argue that the technology could also be used to rid families of devastating inherited diseases like cystic fibrosis or certain cancers. Until now scientists have concentrated on using genome editing techniques on somatic cells - non-reproductive cells like those found in skin, muscle, nerves, bone and liver for example - to help them study diseases. Modifying the DNA of human embryos so that DNA changes are preserved in the germline - the sperm and eggs - means such alterations can be passed on to future generations. Such work is already illegal in many countries around the world including the UK, but is permitted in the US and China. A number of groups around the world are thought to be working on techniques to genetically modify human embryos.","Cloned camel was born in 2009 and called Inzaz, which means achievement .

It has been a difficult week for Rodgers, with the meek manner of last Sunday’s 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa in the FA Cup semi-final ensuring his position has come under scrutiny like at no point during his three-year reign at the club. FSG, Liverpool’s owners, maintain Rodgers’ job is not even up for discussion but that has not stopped Jurgen Klopp – who will leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the campaign – being mentioned as a possible successor. Brendan Rodgers insists he is the man to guide Liverpool to success despite a disappointing season . The Liverpool manager is under pressure following the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa last Sunday . But Rodgers has been boosted by the news that Jordan Henderson (left) has committed his future to the club . But Rodgers has not been rattled by the intensity of the criticism nor is he dwelling on the disappointment. He is concentrating on building Liverpool back up and wants the club to be 'really forceful' when they embark on their summer recruitment drive. ‘After the weekend there is always emotion,’ said Rodgers, who will again be without Daniel Sturridge at West Brom and is 'unsure' when he will return. ‘When you lose a big game this is when you find out you are at a big club because the critics come after you. ‘Three months ago, I was a tactical genius. Now I have lost a couple of games and it is not so good. ‘That is something you have to deal with. When I sit down and look at it, I will hold myself up against anyone to manage this club and to fit the model of what they (FSG) want. I am super ambitious in terms of wanting to win and there will be no greater place to do that than here. ‘Of course in modern football there are lots of processes that go on behind the scenes that people will never be aware of. In terms of what we are trying to do, I do not see anyone better in terms of the hand we were given. We are here to win. We do not want to be “nearly men”. ‘There is no-one more ambitious. If there comes a time when that is not the case and we move on, there will be no-one who respects the owners more than me. But Christ, no, I will fight for my life. If I can get the tools here to help us, we can be really successful.’ Henderson (left) is 'over the moon' after signing new long-term contract at Anfield worth over £100,000 a week . The former Sunderland player hopes Raheem Sterling (pictured) will follow his lead and commit his future . Liverpool have identified a number of targets, principally PSV Eindhoven’s Memphis Depay but they must trump Manchester United; Burnley striker Danny Ings and Manchester City’s James Milner are attractive Bosman options but the feeling is the club need to make a statement of intent. ‘We’ve enough potential and players we can develop and improve,’ said Rodgers. ‘But it is definitely starters we need and we have to be really forceful to get (them).’ There was some good news for Rodgers after Jordan Henderson completed the formalities of signing his new five-year contract, which is heavily incentivised and worth more than £100,000 per week. Liverpool’s vice captain said he was 'over the moon' to conclude the talks, which began at the start of the season and were successfully negotiated by his agent, Neil Fewings. He now hopes Raheem Sterling will follow suit and commit to Liverpool’s future like him, Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho. Sterling, who told BT Sport criticism of his contract talks have been going 'in one ear and out the other', will resume negotiations at the end of the season. ‘Raheem is a good friend of mine and he just has to do what he thinks is best,’ said Henderson. ‘But, if I was giving him advice, I would say: ""This is Liverpool"" – I think this is best place for him. That decision is up to him. He is a fantastic player for us. I hope he stays here and develops with us.'","Brendan Rodgers is under pressure following FA Cup semi-final defeat .

8374,e96d8694cfb0f637db97c2758600cce59e9991ad,"A housekeeper who stole antiques and art treasures worth £500,000 – including a work by Picasso – from a wealthy countess was yesterday warned she was facing a lengthy jail term. Kim Roberts admitted to stealing the precious paintings, vases and silverware from Dowager Countess Bathurst’s Cirencester mansion and her London home. The 58-year-old worked for the countess, 87, and helped herself to the riches, which included a sketch by Picasso and pewter plates, Gloucester Crown Court heard. Roberts’ haul was said to be worth a total of £500,000 at an earlier hearing. Kim Roberts (left) admitted stealing antiques and paintings from her employer, the Countess of Bathurst (right) The Bathurst family home, Cirencester Park, houses artistic treasures stretching back more than three centuries to the first Earl Bathurst, who was a patron of art and literature and a friend of authors including Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope. Among the estate’s collection are portraits by Thomas Gainsborough, George Romney, Peter Lely, and Joshua Reynolds. The 3,000 acre grounds are also home to Cirencester Park Polo Club. Prince Charles has regularly played there over the years and his sons William and Harry have followed in his footsteps. Roberts, of Colyton, Devon, yesterday admitted three charges she had previously denied – including burgling the countess’s Kensington home in Lennox Gardens, where the average asking price is more than £4million. Roberts was working at Cirencester Park, the aristocratic country pile of the Bathursts, in the Cotswolds . Roberts admitted stealing antique vases between May and August in 2013 and stealing a 4x4 Volvo XC90 – worth at least £45,000 – from her previous employer interior designer Emily Olympitis in October 2012. She also admitted fraud after dishonestly telling a domestic household staff recruitment agency that she was born in 1958. At a hearing last year, Roberts admitted stealing art and antiques belonging to the countess between April and May 2013. But she had claimed she was guilty only because the property was put in her car by mistake. Yesterday her barrister Simon Burns said she had now abandoned that claim and fully accepted her responsibility. Roberts was told to prepare for a stretch in prison after she admitted stealing antiques and paintings from the Countess of Bathurst . Her victim – Gloria, the Dowager Countess of Bathurst – is the widow of the eighth Earl Bathurst, Henry, who died in 2011 aged 84. Their son Allen, formerly Lord Apsley, is now the 9th Earl and lives in the Cirencester Park mansion house with his wife Sara. The Bathursts are one of England’s oldest families, originating from Sussex where they owned Bathurst Castle until they were dispossessed of their lands by Edward IV in 1463, after siding with the Lancastrians in the War of the Roses. Roberts did deny three charges yesterday, including stealing antique silver hairbrushes from Lady Juliet Worsley, and another theft of items including a television and a DVD player. She also denied possession of stolen property including a Mont Blanc pen, items of clothing and several accessories. The Crown Prosecution Service has until today to accept her pleas and allow the charges she denies to rest. Roberts’ lawyer told the court he had spoken to the prosecution and believed her guilty pleas would be accepted and that the other charges would not be proceeded with. Judge Jamie Tabor QC gave the prosecution 24 hours to dispute this and released Roberts on bail until May 7 so a pre-sentence report can be prepared by the probation service. And he told Roberts to expect a prison sentence, saying: ‘I don’t want you to be under any illusions about the sentence you will receive. You should make arrangements prior to that date on the basis that you are going to be away for some time.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Kim Roberts worked as a housekeeper for Dowager Countess Bathurst .

7234,83168024389dbcadb536ed5020b542b1aeaeaad3,"A real-life Willy Wonka has laid claim to making the most extravagant chocolate creation - a seven-foot-tall, five-foot-wide Easter Egg made using 352lbs (160kg) of chocolate. Jan Hansen's egg is so big that it took him three days to put together and is made from layers of Belgian chocolate which covers an iron frame. The creation had to be completed using a step ladder and is the equivalent of 1,600 chocolate bars. Jan Hansen with his 7ft tall Easter egg which he will sell off in pieces to raise money for St Barnabas Hospice . Mr Hansen hopes to raise £1,000  from the sale of the egg for St Barnabas Hospice. The giant treat, which has since been wrapped in cellophane complete with a bow on top, was made with melted chocolate which had to be tempered overnight. The 58-year-old chocolatier commissioned an iron worker to make a special frame for his egg, which was then wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film, before being covered in chocolate. Due to the nature of chocolate contracting after it cools, Mr Hansen had to add layer upon layer of chocolate using a palette knife over a three-day period. He then finished the egg off using a 'rough bark' finish. Mr Hansen, who has been in the chocolate business for almost three decades, currently has the egg on display at his shop Hansen's Chocolate House in Folkingham, Sleaford, Linconshire . Layers of chocolate cover an egg-shaped iron frame which the chocolatier had specially commissioned . In the past he has made giant Easter eggs but never one that has sized up to his current creation which  measures five feet in width. On Easter Sunday the egg is to be cracked using a hammer before it is sold off to punters who have already been sizing up the egg. Mr Hansen said: 'It is a fair size and it makes a massive difference compared to the others I have made in the past. 'It's quite fortunate that the conservatory has air conditioning and that it has double doors so we can get it out. 'The actual making was the easy part but I did have a few sleepless nights thinking about it. It was almost like chocolate cladding, I made big sheets of chocolate and put them on the side of the frame. 'It's pretty thick. Nothing tastes quite as good as Easter Egg chocolate and on Easter Sunday customers are going to take it apart and I'm going to crack it with a big hammer. It was exhausting, but it is fantastic to see the look on people's faces. 'I didn't expect people would want to buy the chocolate but it helps to raise more money for the hospice. When they see it they almost don't have to say anything you just have to look at their faces.The kiddies are lost for words, one little boy who was four and funnily enough called Charlie couldn't take it in that it was an Easter Egg. I think it scared him.' The iron frame was wrapped in grease proof paper and cling film . Mr Hansen lost his brother Cullum, 59, two years ago after he was diagnosed with a brain tumour and towards the end of his illness had need of the services provided by a hospice. He added: 'People have been very generous. I'm well on target to hit the £1,000 mark. 'Most people know somebody who has gone through the hospice and know it's a very important part of the health care. People are more than willing to support the hospice and I've felt very proud I've been able to help with this gesture.' He added: 'I've always had a sweet tooth and on a Saturday morning I used to go into the sweet shop and look at the sweets before deciding what to spend my pocket money on. 'Chocolate is my passion, I love it and working with chocolate is better than any medication or therapies. 'I say that we're so lucky working in this industry because 99.9 per cent of customers are always smiling when they walk in, and then they see this and are beaming. 'When I look at it I think ""wow"" but now I'm beginning to think ""what can I do next"" - next year I'll perhaps need a crane and scaffolding.'","Jan Hansen's giant egg is the equivalent of 1,600 chocolate bars .

2943,e1ce4ef020704805785a2203e850a5c2dc375e6f,"(CNN)The bizarre circumstances surrounding Freddie Gray's death have inflamed tensions across the country. How could a man suffer a severe spinal cord injury after getting arrested? And what happened in the 30 minutes before he was taken to a hospital? Gray wavered in and out of a coma and died Sunday, one week after his arrest. It's not clear how he suffered the spinal cord injury. But Gray is far from the only suspect who died under questionable circumstances after he was already in custody. Here are several other cases: . Date of arrest: March 31, 2015 . Date of death: March 31, 2015 . What happened: . Police in Vineland, New Jersey, responded to a call of a disorderly person, and White was arrested and handcuffed. Police dispatch recordings include an officer saying White ""tried to grab my gun."" One witness, Agustin Ayala, told the Vineland Daily Journal that White was resisting arrest. But two others told WCAU that police attacked White while he was already handcuffed. ""They punched him, stomped him, kicked him and then they let the dog out of the car,"" Ricardo Garcia told the station. ""The dog bit him on his face and around his body. There's no call for that. Once a man is handcuffed and unconscious, you should have stuck him in the patrol car and take him to the police station."" Witness Luis Martinez gave a similar account. ""The other cop let the dog out, and they just kept punching him and the dog kept biting him at the same time,"" Martinez told WCAU. ""He was on the floor, like he was knocked out."" As White was taken to a hospital, he became unresponsive, NJ.com reported. He was pronounced dead at the hospital. The aftermath: . The Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office has been investigating White's death, and officials have been waiting for the results of White's autopsy to learn the exact cause of death, NJ.com said. Two Vineland officers have been placed on administrative leave. And after Vineland police received criticism on its Facebook page about White's case, the department started hiding unfavorable comments, the Press of Atlantic City reported. An activist filed an Open Public Records Act request, saying the department's official Facebook page was a matter of public record. Vineland police later restored the critical comments on its page. Date of arrest: March 2, 2014 . Date of death: March 2, 2014 . What happened: . Sheriff's deputies in New Iberia, Louisiana, claimed White shot and killed himself in the back of a squad car -- even though White had been frisked and handcuffed. ""Short of him being Houdini or David Copperfield, it's not possible,"" White family attorney Carol Powell-Lexing said. The incident began when authorities were responding to a fight in a gas station parking lot. About six blocks from the store, an Iberia Parish deputy saw White and stopped him, state police said. According to the service report from the Sheriff's Office, Cpl. Justin Ortis received no description of the men involved in the fight. He was told only that they were black, ""and one of the males mentioned having a gun,"" the report said. White consented to a pat-down, and Ortis found marijuana in his pocket. Attorney Benjamin Crump said that detail makes the official narrative even more suspicious. ""If you pat someone down and you can feel a small package of marijuana, wouldn't you feel a gun?"" he said. State police said once White arrived at the police station, he refused to get out of the patrol car. ""As the deputy requested assistance from other deputies, White produced a handgun and fired one round, striking himself in the back,"" state police said. White was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The aftermath: . An autopsy concluded White's death was a suicide -- but said he was shot in the chest, not in the back, like police had said. The autopsy report also said White was ""reportedly in a locked patrol car with his hands handcuffed behind him when officers heard a shot and found the decedent slumped over."" State police have handed over their investigation to prosecutors, who said a decision won't be made until a federal civil rights investigation wraps up. Date of police encounter: July 5, 2011 . Date of death: July 10, 2011 . What happened: . Officers in Fullerton, California, were responding to a call about a homeless man looking into car windows and pulling on handles of parked cars. Video of the incident showed Thomas, who was schizophrenic, slow to cooperate. Fullerton police Officer Manuel Ramos  then tells him: ""You see my fists? They're getting ready to f--- you up."" Thomas, who is unarmed and shirtless, stands and another officer walks over. They hit him with their batons and hold him on the ground as he begs for help. ""OK, I'm sorry, dude. I'm sorry!"" he screams. At one point, Thomas says he can't breathe. The officers tell him to lie on his stomach, put his hands behind his back and relax. Toward the end of the beating, the video shows, Thomas cries out for his father: ""Dad! Help me. Help me. Help me, Dad."" By the end of the video, he is lying in a pool of blood. The aftermath: . The Orange County coroner ruled Thomas' death a homicide and said he died after having his chest compressed, leaving him unable to breathe. Thomas' mother, Cathy Thomas, received a $1 million settlement from the city of Fullerton. Officer Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli was charged of involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Both pleaded not guilty. In 2014, a jury acquitted both Ramos and Cicinelli. Date of arrest: September 6, 2013 . Date of death: September 7, 2013 . What happened: . Azucena was arrested after running a red light and leading Los Angeles police on a chase. Over the next half hour, Azucena repeatedly said he had asthma and couldn't breathe, the Los Angeles Times reported. Officers continued ignoring him. ""Help me, help me, help me,"" he said, according to a report by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners. ""I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Help me, please."" ""You can breathe just fine,"" one sergeant told him, according to the Times. ""You can talk, so you can breathe."" He didn't breathe for much longer. Azucena was so weak that officers had to carry him to a station's holding cell for booking and left him face-down on the floor, the Times reported. By the time paramedics arrived, Azucena's heart had stopped. The aftermath: . A coroner concluded that asthma probably killed Azucena and that his death was an accident. Last month, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously agreed to a $1.35 million settlement for Azucena's mother, the Times said. The investigation into the officers' actions is ongoing. Date of arrest: November 19, 2013 . Date of death: November 19, 2013 . What happened: . An officer in Durham, North Carolina, was taking Huerta to the police station for a second-degree trespassing violation. The Durham Police Department said the teen died from a self-inflicted gunshot while handcuffed in the back of the squad car. Durham police Chief Jose Lopez said gunshot residue tests were conducted on Huerta and the arresting officer, and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation ""found that Huerta was wearing gloves and that his gloves had a saturation of gunshot residue on it. Officer (Samuel) Duncan's revealed that he had no gunshot residue on his hands."" But Huerta's family, like Victor White's family in Louisiana, suspect foul play by police. The aftermath: . Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Durham to decry Huerta's death. Some carried banners that read, ""Fue Matado Por La Policia"" or ""Murdered By Police."" A vigil for Huerta turned violent, with six people arrested. The police chief said that as a Hispanic, he had trouble believing the allegations among the Hispanic community that Durham police unfairly target Latinos. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin and Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Police say Victor White III and Jesus Huerta shot themselves while handcuffed in cars .

9399,b542d4b1c8f05f2558ebea97c42e814d41f7a204,"Matej Vydra's superb volley helped keep Watford on the trail for automatic promotion as they recorded a 2-0 victory over a spirited Millwall side, who sank further into relegation trouble. Millwall were on top for much of the first half but a stunning hit from Vydra saw the Hornets take in a slender advantage at half-time. Aiden O'Brien was a constant menace for the hosts - who had an early penalty shout turned down - but Watford were far too clinical, as Adlene Guedioura slotted a vital second goal shortly after the break. Matej Vydra fires home his stunning volley from the edge of the box to put Watford into the lead . Vydra is congratulated by his Watford team-mates as his goal moved the club towards automatic promotion . Millwall keeper David Forde was called into action in the first minute, doing well to deny Troy Deeney after the striker had broken the offside trap. The Lions quickly gathered momentum and despite some promising approach play - with O'Brien at the heart of much of it - failed to create any meaningful opportunities. And the home side had a legitimate penalty shout after Ben Watson bundled over of Ed Upson, as the midfielder jinked in from the right, but that went unpunished. After Watford weathered the storm, Vydra produced his moment of inspiration by volleying in from just outside the box in the 26th minute. Forde was helpless as the Czech thumped the ball into the far corner from Ikechi Anya's cross. Millwall, playing with renewed hope of survival after a first win in 10 on Good Friday, then squandered a golden opportunity when Martyn Woolford failed to pick out O'Brien lurking unmarked two yards from goal. Adlene Guedioura celebrates in front of the travelling fans after making it 2-0 and sealing the three points . Troy Deeney, who went close early on, is tackled by Millwall's Shaun Williams during the Championship clash . The hosts also ended the half in the ascendency as Jimmy Abdou's scuffed shot was well saved by Heurelho Gomes. Millwall huffed and puffed as they had in the first-half, but created few chances of any note. They came closest to boosting their slim survival hopes when O'Brien robbed Matthew Connolly of possession, but Gomes saved well. In the 54th minute, Anya - as he did for Vydra's opener - created Watford's second. The Scottish winger combined with Troy Deeney to outfox Shaun Cummings and Sid Nelson before squaring for Guedioura, who tucked away a six-yard tap-in. Deeney dives in to stop Dan Harding getting past, as Millwall slipped closer to relegation . It was a goal that Watford's second-half performance deserved, as they overcame Millwall's superiority before the break to showcase the quality that puts them on the brink of the Premier League. They twice came close to adding to the lead, as first Vydra then Odion Ighalo ran free on goal. Forde managed to gather the ball at Vydra's feet and then saved agilely from substitute Ighalo. Avoiding defeat would have equalled their longest unbeaten run of the season at four games, but the Lions more than likely need to go without a loss in all five of their remaining fixtures to stand any chance of beating the drop.","Matej Vydra converts Ikechi Anya cross after 26 mintues .

1964,b464d11c18c83a631d3da0213b3a35d75fea1bfc,"Northampton ruled George North out of their game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday and sent him to see a neurosurgeon. The Wales and Lions wing has been removed from the firing line by his club ahead of the biggest game of their season to date following his third alarming head injury in the space of two months. The 22-year-old was knocked unconscious when struck by Wasps No 8 Nathan Hughes's knee as he was scoring a try at Franklin's Gardens last Friday night. Northampton have ruled out winger George North for the game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday . North lies motionless on the Franklin's Gardens turf after being knocked out against Wasps . Having opted to act in the best interests of their marquee player — despite the importance of a Champions Cup quarter-final in France — the Saints have taken an encouraging step in response to fears about North's long-term health. Instead of merely abiding by the minimum, six-day return-to-play protocols, the Aviva Premiership champions have erred on the side of caution. 'In theory we could consider him,' said Jim Mallinder, Northampton's director of rugby. 'If it was his first one (head knock), then we would be considering him if he passed all the protocols and was available. Seeing as it's not his first, then it's the sensible thing to take specialist opinion. 'We won't play him at the weekend. Clearly he had a nasty knock. It was unfortunate. He did get knocked unconscious for a very short period of time. We'll listen to what the neurologist says. He's the expert. As always we'll listen to his advice.' In Tuesday's Sportsmail, former Scotland full back Rory Lamont — who has suffered the after-effects of concussion injuries — called for the Welsh icon (left) to be rested for six months, saying: 'It's a complete disgrace that it has got to this stage. George has been let down.' He was not the only voice raising the alarm, but the Saints are aggrieved that distant observers are weighing in with comments without being completely aware of the specifics. Mallinder called for a calm, measured assessment of the situation. 'There's been lots of opinion over the last few days in particular,' he said. 'We've got to be careful that we don't blow anything out of proportion. 'It's a tough game. George has said that himself. We're always going to have incidents, but player welfare will always come first.There's a balance to it. We've got to make sure we don't get hysterical about it, but we are sensible. Clearly there are players who, if they've had a knock, need time off to make sure that their bodies recover. A head injury is no different to any other type of injury. 'You can't just stop people playing rugby. People who play the game understand that there are inherent dangers. 'Players are now very well looked after and I think it's probably not at the senior level where you need to worry. It's probably a little bit lower down, maybe schoolboys and junior rugby, where players don't get as well looked after as ours.' Nathan Hughes arrives late as North touches down - moments later his leg connected with the wing's head . The Welshman receives medical treatment on the pitch before being taken off on a stretcher . In reference to last Friday night's incident, Mallinder stressed that North had considerable medical support, in contrast to how it used to be in rugby — when attitudes were very different. 'It's something now in the game which has improved,' he added. 'It's brilliant. Straight after the incident the players recognised it (the severity of the injury). 'We've got two doctors available, physios available — and they know exactly what to do. 'It's not right, but I remember playing 30 years ago and your touch judge was the man who looked after you and basically you got a sponge on your head and you were back out if you could walk. 'Clearly the game is much improved for what we've got now. I'm not concerned for him (North). We've got to look after him.' On Tuesday night, Hughes was banned until April 28 for his 'reckless' actions — colliding with North when the try scorer was on the ground, unable to protect his head. The sanction has divided opinion, with Wasps players incensed by what they regard as an unduly heavy-handed punishment for an offence which the disciplinary panel accepted was not malicious. Asked if he had any sympathy with Hughes, Mallinder initially refused to comment, but added: 'I said at the time I think it was a red-card offence. I still do. 'Therefore the disciplinary process has taken place and that's what he's got. Meanwhile, Wasps will make a statement over whether they will appeal Hughes' ban. After receiving the full written judgement explaining the decision, the club stated: 'We'll consider our options and make a decision.' North is congratulated by team-mates after scoring the first of his two tries against Wasps last Friday night .","Northampton have ruled out winger George North for the game against Clermont Auvergne on Saturday .

The train hurtled through at high speed shortly after a group of riders went through the barrier . One rider from the Belgian Lotto team was clipped by a barrier as it came down. John Degenkolb, winner of the race famed for its 26 sections of bone-jarring cobbled roads, was among the group who went through the barrier as it closed. Race organisers said it had not been possible for the leaders to stop in time. 'Several riders deliberately, and against all safety rules, crossed a closed safety barrier,' said a SNCF statement announcing the complaint to French prosecutors. 'Millions of television viewers saw live this extremely grave and irresponsible action which could have been tragic,' the company added. 'A few seconds later, a TGV ran on this line and could have hit the peloton.' When the last rider had gone through the crossing, a police motorcycle was in place to stop more riders going through. The riders are held at a level crossing in the Paris-Roubaix race as a train approaches . A number of cyclists breached the barrier to cross the track before the train sped through . The last cyclist appeared to cross the track around eight seconds before the train went through . Normally riders who go through a closed safety crossing are disqualified. But Guy Dobbelaere, president of the jury of race commissioners, defended the action of the riders on Sunday. 'It wasn't possible for the leading riders to stop sufficiently safely,' said Dobbelaere. 'The peloton was 10 metres away when the barrier started to close.' Race director Thierry Gouvenou added: 'By neutralising the race for a few moments to not penalise those who stopped, we respected the spirit of the rule. 'In theory, those who pass when the barrier is down are thrown out of the race. 'This time, that would have been unjust in respect of those riders who weren't identified,' said Gouvenou. German John Degenkolb won the race and was one of the riders who went through the closed barrier . Degenkolb celebrates his win alongside Zdenek Stybar (left) and Greg van Avermaet (right) Race officials slowed the leading riders so that those held up by the barrier could catch up. In 2006, three riders were disqualified for going through a closed railway crossing. The three - Leif Hoste and Peter van Petegem of Belgium and Russian Vladimir Guseve - were less than 10 kilometers (six miles) from the finish and had been disputing top places.","Railway company condemns the cyclists 'grave and irresponsible action'

10376,b8ea6218e60d9ad403cb1270c66838f5a539e40f,"Yet another scientific study has found no link between autism and the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) - even among high risk children. The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), are based on a study of about 95,000 young people. All those in the study had older siblings. Some of the elder children had autism and some did not. Numerous studies over the last 15 years have ruled out a link between the MMR vaccine and autism . Since autism can run in families, researchers decided to look at whether vaccines could make autism even more likely in children who had siblings with autism. They found that vaccines had no effect on autism risk, whether or not a sibling in the family was diagnosed. 'Consistent with studies in other populations, we observed no association between MMR vaccination and increased ASD risk among privately insured children,' said the study, led by Anjali Jain, a doctor in Falls Church, Virginia. 'We also found no evidence that receipt of either one or two doses of MMR vaccination was associated with an increased risk of ASD among children who had older siblings with ASD.' Autism is on the rise, and affects as many as one in 68 children in the United States, but its causes remain poorly understood. Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield. He was later stripped of his medical license . Fears about vaccines and autism began to spread after the publication in 1998 of an article by Andrew Wakefield that purported to find a link between the MMR vaccine and autism in 12 children. It was later found to be fraudulent and was retracted by the journal that published it. As the author, Wakefield was stripped of his medical license. But concerns over vaccine safety, particularly in the Internet age, have proven difficult to quell. 'Although a substantial body of research over the last 15 years has found no link between the MMR vaccine and ASD, parents and others continue to associate the vaccine with ASD,' said the JAMA study. 'Surveys of parents who have children with ASD suggest that many believe the MMR vaccine was a contributing cause.' Children who have an older sibling with autism are less likely to get vaccinated, the study found. The MMR vaccination rate for the children with unaffected siblings was 92 percent by age five. In contrast, the MMR vaccination rates for children with older siblings with ASD was 86 percent by age five. An accompanying editorial by Bryan King, a doctor at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, said the data is clear. 'The only conclusion that can be drawn from the study is that there is no signal to suggest a relationship between MMR and the development of autism in children with or without a sibling who has autism,' King wrote. 'Taken together, some dozen studies have now shown that the age of onset of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, the severity or course of ASD does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children, and now the risk of ASD recurrence in families does not differ between vaccinated and unvaccinated children.'","The findings, in the Journal of the American Medical Association, are based on a study of about 95,000 young people .

Elijah Overcomer, 26, left Gloriavale, a town of about 500 on New Zealand's west coast,  with his wife, Rosanna, 29, and their children in late March 2013. Shortly following their departure, the family watched the 2004 psychological thriller The Village, by M. Night Shyamalan. Mr Overcomer said the film - where residents of a pretend 19th century town fear the 'wicked' outside world - was a 'good comparison with our community', especially in their views of the greater world. '(In the film), all the kids have grown up and been told the outside is unsafe. They even make their own scare tactics to scare people from going outside the wee village,' he said. 'It's kind of the same thing here. You're told if you leave Gloriavale you're lost, you lose your Salvation.' Life in Gloriavale: Wearing their customary blue uniforms, Elijah Overcomer, now 26, wife Rosanna, now 29 and two of the three children they left with are photographed inside the commune . Gloriavale baby: Daughter Honour is pictured decked out in her Gloriavale uniform . Young love: In Gloriavale blue, Elijah and Rosanna are pictured mucking around. Gloriavale, a secretive Christian commune, is nestled on the banks of Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's west coast . Living in the now: The Overcomers have lived outside Gloriavale for two years . Sharing candid photographs of his family's time in Gloriavale with Daily Mail Australia, Mr Overcomer said  he had been told there was 'a lot of sin' and 'bad things' in the greater world. 'You almost only get to know about the evil while you're there. 'That's all you know to be outside Gloriavale, is a lot of evil and that sort of thing.' But following their departure, the family were 'blown away' by the kindness and support shown to them by New Zealand churches in Christchurch and Timaru. The latter town, some 300kms south of Gloriavale, has become home to several former members of the sect recently following a virtual exodus. According to Sunday NZ program,  22 residents have left in the past two months. Among them includes the Ben Canaan family of 14, who famously walked out this March. 'When we left we received so much help and gifts from people especially churches at Christchurch and then at Timaru,' Mr Overcomer told Daily Mail Australia. 'People (were) just helping us out giving us clothing, kitchen gear - heaps of stuff - and we were quite shocked with that. 'We've been blown away by how much love we've received outside of there. Even from people who aren't Christians, as well. 'There's a lot of really kind, caring people who want to help you. I mean, even in our district, you meet someone new and they just want to help. Just blown away. The family have faced two particular challenges leaving Gloriavale. The most devastating is that the couple are mostly unable to contact their large extended family inside the commune. 'Not being able to talk to them and see them is definitely the worst thing,' said Mr Overcomer, who is now managing a dairy farm and living in Timaru. 'Everyone can adapt into a different lifestyle. But you can't adapt from leaving your family.' A scene from the 2004 M. Night Shyamalan film, The Village. In the film, residents believed they were living in a 19th century village - but in reality the village had been founded in the 1970s . In an interview, Mr Overcomer compared the views residents in Gloriavale had of the outside world with those held in the psychological thriller The Village (above) l . Love in Gloriavale: Elijah is pictured here with Rosanna in scenic Gloriavale . One of the Overcomer's little boys, Seth, is pictured at Gloriavale . Love in Gloriavale: Rosanna is photographed here with three children, Seth (left), Zac and Honour . The deeply religious family were also forced to grapple with their views about Christianity. They were particularly afraid that, by walking out of Gloriavale they may have lost their 'Salvation' with God. 'I guess the biggest thing, other than leaving family, was feeling like our salvation was lost. 'For us, we felt that was the worst thing. Especially my wife really struggled with that. 'It wasn't until we got good teaching from the pastor at our church and he taught us through the Bible really well so we could be confident that Gloriavale was wrong and that we were actually free to go wherever we like... 'That really gave us a lot of security in what we've done. What we've been told wasn't true... You still have to tell yourself that.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist. Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book Sins of the Father, said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.'' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can. That's why they have big families.'Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt. And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms.The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels. Little Honour, pictured, grew up in Gloriavale and can be seen wearing her miniature blue uniform . Known by the name 'Hopeful Christian', Neville Cooper (pictured) was convicted of sex abuse and spent 11 months in prison in 1995 . Mr Overcomer was initially kicked out of the Gloriavale for five weeks around Christmas 2012 after 'asking too many questions' of the Elders, who rule the sect. Among the matters he asked about was the history of founder Neville Cooper, who was convicted and spent nearly a year imprisoned on sex abuse charges in 1995 . 'I don't know what really turned the corner with them. 'I guess the main thing is I even had the guts or whatever it was to ask them, to question it. 'It might seem strange looking in from out there. (But) growing up there you're real scared of them (the Elders), scared of getting in trouble with them. 'It was quite a courageous move to ask questions of them. Obviously I expected answers.' After five weeks of 'hell' separated from his family, Mr Overcomer 'repented' for his sins and returned home to Gloriavale. But the family soon decided to pick up and leave. In Gloriavale, women are required to wear a blue, full-length robe (pictured in a documentary above) Gloriavale families live together in large, communal hostels . One of the reasons the Overcomers decided to leave Gloriavale was to spend more time with their children, rather than them being 'raised as a part of a system' Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up. 'I worked outside Gloriavale, ""sharemilking"" on a neighbour's farm for the community. It was kind of then I thought I'd like my own house and things. 'And I'd like to look after my kids personally. There (in Gloriavale) your kids are raised by the system I guess. 'School, pre-school children go to pre-school - you don't really get a whole lot of time with them. 'With a farming lifestyle, you get to spend a bit more time with your children. You have a bigger input in their lives. Mr Overcomer, who had worked outside Gloriavale, particularly wanted to spend more time with his children as they grew up . Gloriavale is located on Lake Haupiri, on the west coast of New Zealand's South Island. Many families have left for Timaru, around 300kms south . He told Daily Mail Australia one of his 'biggest issues' with Gloriavale is how they separate dissenters from their families. 'That's the biggest thing I want to see stopped. I had a guy working for me for a while - he's got back in now. 'He was out for six months, away from his wife and family. He had three little children. 'It's that sort of behaviour I want to see stopped.' Mr Overcomer now manages a dairy farm with more than 700 cows. He said the family, who now have two more children, had 'definitely' adjusted to life in Timaru. 'We've been doing well.'

932,236b50e3e43142afbe0ca86ff4f522dac2555fe6,"(CNN)A large storm system dubbed Typhoon Maysak is churning over the Pacific Ocean, days away from a possible direct hit on the Philippines. Maysak is moving west-northwest after skirting the Federated States of Micronesia, according to the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Its eye is projected to make landfall in the central or northern part of the Philippine island of Luzon on Sunday, though the country's residents could start feeling its effects days before. That could interrupt the Easter celebration for many in the predominantly Catholic nation, which may be socked by heavy rains and potent winds. The International Red Cross noted that ""many people are expected to throng coastal areas at this time."" Images of the typhoon as seen from the International Space Station were posted to Twitter, including a Vine video showing the swirling eye of the storm. The storm has weakened and is expected to lose more strength before it reaches the Philippines. Its maximum sustained winds on Wednesday were 150 mph, making it a super typhoon in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's definition. But by Thursday, the winds' strength had declined to around 132 mph -- no longer a super typhoon but still the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera told CNN that Maysak could weaken further to become a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Philippine coast. ""This will not be a catastrophic storm,"" Cabrera said. That said, it could still cause flooding and bring strong winds, he cautioned. The Philippines is frequently hit by typhoons. In December, for instance, Hagupit killed at least 18 people in the East Asian nation and injured hundreds more. But that devastation paled in comparison to the havoc wrought by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which killed more than 6,000 people and injured more than 27,000 others. That typhoon, considered to be among the strongest storms ever to make landfall, hit the eastern city of Tacloban especially hard. The irony of the upcoming storm is its timing: in April, just after the Philippines Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration officially declared the onset of the nation's dry, or summer, season. PAGASA meteorologist Shelley Ignacio predicts Maysak -- which is called Chedeng in the Philippines -- will bring heavy rains to Luzon starting on Friday, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council went on red alert on Wednesday because of the storm, the news agency reports. That alert means all relevant personnel are on standby and the public should be on guard for possible effects of the storm. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Maysak has sustained winds of more than 130 mph but is expected to weaken .

The family of a seven-year-old skier killed in the French Alps have paid tribute to their 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and revealed he got lost in woods before sliding towards a 164ft cliff. It is thought Carwyn Scott-Howell may have entered the dense woodland because he thought it was a shortcut to his hotel in the ski resort of Flaine. He was on holiday with his mother Ceri Scott-Howell, nine-year-old sister Antonia and brother Gerwyn, 19. Carwyn's parents, ex-nurse Mrs Scott-Howell and husband Rhys, a former butcher, rent out self-catering cottages and run a farm. They bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'. Carwyn would help feed cows and pigs on the farm which has won prizes for its speciality sausages and has sold scotch eggs to Prime Minister David Cameron. His family last night said his death had left them feeling 'utter devastation' with a 'vast void in our hearts', adding that he was 'a very competent skier' who had started aged three. A statement released through the Foreign Office  said: 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky'. Last night, the family, from Talybont-on-Usk, near Brecon, Wales, remained in the Alpine resort of Flaine – a 38-mile drive from Chamonix – in free accommodation provided by the hotel. They are expected to leave today. Police sources said the boy's body may be expatriated today after final post-mortem examinations yesterday. The family were enjoying the last run of their trip in perfect conditions in the town of Flaine when Antonia fell over and her mother stopped to help her. Within moments Carwyn, who friends say modelled himself on survival specialist and TV presenter Bear Grylls, is believed to have taken the chance to go skiing in nearby woodland. Trbute: Carwyn Scott-Howell's family called the 'caring' boy 'daring and determined' after he was killed after falling from a cliff while on an Easter skiing trip to the French resort of Flaine . He skied 100 yards off-piste, where trees were just a yard apart. Unable to weave through, he took his skis off and is thought to have started sliding on his bottom or running. Last night, there were reports Carwyn could have been trying to get to his hotel, Les Terrasses d'Eos, which can be seen from the ski slope. He continued 400 yards, until he plunged off the side of the mountain and fell 164ft. It is believed he landed on a rocky ledge. In a statement released to the Foreign Office, his family described Carwyn as a 'daring, outgoing, determined little boy' and a 'very competent skier and snowboarder'. They said they were enjoying their last ski run together when Carwyn's sister 'lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead'. 'He was a very daring outgoing determined little boy whose handsome smile lit up any room and made life full of laughter with never a dull moment. Seven years is too short a time to be an angel in the sky. 'Carwyn was a very competent skier and snowboarder who had started skiing at the age of three and spent several weeks each year skiing. We had spent the most happy ski holiday together in the French ski resort of Flaine.' The statement went on to explain how the family became separated on their last run of the day on Friday afternoon. 'The family were all enjoying their last ski run over the small jumps and bumps at the side of the slope together, when Carwyn's sister lost her ski on a jump and at this point Carwyn skied ahead,' it said. 'The family cannot explain their feeling of utter devastation with a vast void in their hearts. The family would like to thank all their friends and family for their support at this time and the vast help from the British Consulate. 'The family now ask for time to grieve in private.' Scene: Carwyn's family are believed to be staying in this hotel, close to the slopes where the seven-year-old died . Family: The youngster lived on a farm near Brecon, which is well known for its produce. Here Prime Minister David Cameron buys scotch eggs from Carwyn's father Rhys at the Royal Welsh Show last year . After a search spanning two hours, a rescue helicopter spotted Carwyn's body. As the vehicle was unable to land, crews were winched down to reach the boy, who was declared dead at the scene after 7pm. Michel Ollagnon, police commander from nearby Bonneville, said Carwyn was found wearing his glasses, dispelling reports he went into the woods because he did not have them on. Despite initial reports that Carwyn's mother had let him try the last run of the day alone, Mr Ollagnon said: 'In fact…he went up with his mother, sister and brother. 'The sister fell, the mother stopped and the little boy went off…Why he went in that direction, we do not know … One thing is sure, the skis were found quite a way from the cliffside.' Pierre-Yves Michau, the judge heading the investigation into Carwyn's death, said the inquiry was still trying to verify all the circumstances surrounding the incident. He said: 'The mother last saw her son at about 4pm. She returned to where they were staying because she thought he had returned on his own to the resort. But he wasn't there so she returned to the mountain. Accident: The Welsh schoolboy is believed to have got lost in the woods pictured here, before falling to his death from the cliffs below . Carwyn, who friends say modelled himself on survival specialist and TV presenter Bear Grylls, is believed to have taken the chance to go skiing in woodland to get back to Flaine, pictured . 'She asked everyone if they had seen him. It was about 6pm when she spoke to the pisteurs because she thought he had returned on his own.' He added: 'He had left the piste and then was in the forest and he took his skis off because perhaps the snow was not very good. 'He descended. He continued on foot. Between the piste and where he fell it would have been about 15 minutes. 'There are footprints in the snow after the point where the skis had been left for several tens of metres.' Family friends in Brecon yesterday paid tribute to the boy. One said: 'Carwyn loved exploring. That's what he spent all his time doing. 'He was a little adventurer. He was quite fearless really. He'd always be out in nature.' Another friend added: 'He idolised Bear Grylls and loved spending his time in the woods … He'd grown up in the mountains and [was] used to those kind of conditions, which makes this awful accident all the more tragic.' Holiday: Carwyn's family has said 'the most happy ski holiday' in Flaine, France, turned to tragedy after Carwyn became detached from the group on the last run of the day . A worker at Flaine hire shop Ski Set, who gave her name as Charlotte, said: 'The slope is about 40 metres [131ft] wide. 'You would have to really try to come off the piste … The trees are about 1.5 to two metres [6ft 6in] high. He must have had to push through … It seems he could see the hotel from where he was standing and tried to get there on foot.' The family were well known at food fairs and farmers markets and Carwyn would often help out on their stall. The Prime Minister briefly met Carwyn's father Rhys at the Royal Welsh Show last year when he bought Scotch eggs. A spokesman Mr Cameron said: 'This was an incredibly tragic accident and the Prime Minister's thoughts are with Carwyn's family.' Local farmer Peter Davies said: 'They were a great family not to mention great farmers who made really good sausages. It's just so sad to think what they must be going through right now. The whole farming fraternity is praying for them.' Children and teachers at the school Carwyn attended faced a difficult first day back after the Easter break. Officials at Ysgol Y Bannau in Brecon said a tribute was paid to Carwyn at a special assembly. Headteacher Emyr Jones said; 'The school mourns the loss of one of its pupils, Carwyn Scott-Howell - a lively and likeable pupil who will be greatly missed. 'We at Ysgol y Bannau, as an extended community, the staff, pupils, parents and governors, extend our deepest sympathy to the family; our thoughts and prayers are with them.' A book of condolence has also been opened at Brecon Cathedral, where a picture of of Carwyn in a karate suit was placed next to candles lit in his memory.","Carwyn Scott-Howell, 7, died on a family holiday in Flaine in French Alps .

1166,046b7d1b181fcb7e80b95f58eda938cec7a0735c,"Tracy Walters, 48, (right) died after her husband Ian's (left) car veered off the M1 motorway last year . A church treasurer accused of killing his wife by deliberately smashing his 4x4 vehicle into a tree at 84mph has described their early sex life together as ‘dramatic’. Ian Walters is accused of murdering his wife of two years after their relationship had collapsed because she was no longer able to satisfy his sexual demands. Walters, who also worked as a driving test examiner, veered off the M1 on the way back from an unsuccessful ‘make or break’ trip with his wife Tracy, Leicester Crown Court has heard. The 51-year-old’s Mitsubishi L200 Animal ploughed through undergrowth before hitting a tree – leaving Mrs Walters, 48, with serious injuries. She was flown to hospital by helicopter but died two days after the crash in March last year. Walters, who was also badly hurt in the incident, was charged with his wife’s murder two months later – ten days after her funeral. The prosecution is claiming that conflict over sex was a main reason the couple’s marriage had fallen apart. Charles Miskin, prosecuting, said earlier in the trial: ‘One of the principal issues was sex. He seemed to want it all the time and she couldn’t cope with his demands.’ But giving evidence yesterday, Walters described his love life with Tracy as ‘very fulfilling’, adding: ‘It was very exciting and adventurous. She taught me things I never knew. It was very refreshing and usually initiated by Tracy rather than myself.’ Walters went on to say that when they had sex it tended to be ‘long, dramatic and adventurous’ but lacked the ‘intimacy’ he craved. He added: ‘What I needed was intimacy. What I needed was more than the touching. I wanted to fall asleep in each other’s arms.’ Quizzed over texts Tracy had sent to friends complaining that Walters had made her feel like ‘a sex object’, Walters agreed with the defence counsel that ‘his sex drive was higher than Tracy’s’. And he admitted that as their relationship had worn on their sex life had waned. The jury also heard that the couple had a ‘troubled’ relationship, with Mrs Walters telling relatives and police that her husband had been abusive to her. The couple, who were said to have had a 'troubled' relationship, had married in Cyprus in 2012 but their relationship is alleged to have become abusive soon afterwards, jurors heard . Mrs Walters, a keen horse rider, was flown to hospital following the collision in Markfield, Leicester, but died two days later from her injuries . She made an application under ‘Clare’s Law’ to discover if he had a violent past. The pair, who had both been married once before, had grown-up children from their previous relationships. They started dating in 2011, and got married a year later in Cyprus. Mr Miskin told the court that the abuse started almost straight away, with Mrs Walters showing relatives bruises she claimed her husband had inflicted. Mrs Walters also texted a relative of one of her sons just an hour before the crash to say: ‘I need him arrested when I get back, but I am scared because he is so volatile and I don’t want to wind him up.’ The couple were returning to their home in Swindon when Walters suddenly swerved his car off the carriageway and into a tree. The prosecution claim that Mrs Walters ‘couldn’t cope with her husband’s demands’ in bed, and that Walters purposely crashed to show his wife ‘who was in charge’. But Walters is claiming that at the time of the crash he had been taking antidepressants which sometimes made him drowsy. He told the court that he could recall two times when he had fallen asleep at the wheel, the last of which was on a motorway in 2002. He said he had also had three fainting episodes in the two years prior to the crash. Walters denies murder. The trial continues. The Mitsubishi L200 veered onto an embankment near junction 22 of the southbound carriageway in March last year. Pictured: Emergency services at the scene of the crash .

A new study claims these 'taxibots' could cut the number of cars needed to perform the same number of journeys per day by 90 per cent. The finding comes amid reports that companies such as Google and Uber are working on technology to develop driverless taxis. Scroll down for video . Car-congested cities could become a thing of the past, provided people are prepared to ride-share with a robot driver. Pictured is an interior view of a Google self-driving car showing the video and the data the car uses to 'see' the road. Google is believed to be working on technology for self-driving cabs, but hasn't revealed details . The study, by Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  used data from Lisbon in Portugal. By plugging the data into a computer model, they simulated how such self-driving, communal cabs would affect traffic. Even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent. The authors said replacing personal cars with self-driving cabs would also free valuable real estate currently used for public parking - equivalent to over 200 football pitches in Lisbon’s case. Major technology firms are already banking on self-driving taxis to be the future of transportation. Even with only one passenger per ride and no complementary public transport, the number of cars still dropped by 77 per cent. In this image is one Google's autonomous vehicles pictured with Google Chairman Eric Schmidt (left) and  US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx (right) Last year, for instance, ride-sharing service Uber said it could replace all of its drivers with autonomous vehicles. CEO Travis Kalanick admitted the technology would keep costs down, and these savings could then be passed on to its customers. Corey Clothier, who is co-ordinating the trials told DailyMail.com that an accident involved a driverless car is inevitable - although he added none have taken place in his pilots. 'Systems will fail, people's judgements will fail,' he said. 'If someone jumps out from a blind spot from a vehicle, if it can't stop, it can't stop.' A recent report by the Institution of Engineering and Technology highlighted research that showed human drivers change their behaviour when using the same roads as autonomous cars. Motorists were found to copy the driving style of the computer controlled cars by leaving less space between them and the vehicle in front, but were less able to react quickly. However, many experts say that driverless cars could actually reduce the risk of accidents as computers are able to react a lot faster than humans. Google has also been teaching its vehicles to drive more safely by giving them instructions on 'defensive driving' styles. They have also been experimenting with teaching the vehicles 'body language' to communicate with other drivers what its intentions are. Speaking at the Code Conference in California, Kalanick said: ‘The reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car - you're paying for the other dude in the car. ‘When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle.’ Google was an early backer of the San Francisco-based firm, investing $258 million (£170 million) in the controversial ride-sharing service through its venture capital arm in August 2013. But last month unnamed source told Bloomberg that Google is preparing to offer its own taxi service, and it was likely to use its driverless cars. The report said that Google had told Uber's board of this possibility, and executives had seen screenshots of what appears to be a Google ride-sharing app, currently being used by employees. While driverless taxis are still some way off from becoming a reality, a separate report last month found they could soon find their way into our airports and campuses. Ten US cities will roll out automated vehicle pilot projects this year, with the first being unveiled in Tampa Bay, Florida in the spring. Meanwhile, trials will launch in another 12 to 20 US locations by the end of next year, which means driverless cars could be on the roads in up to 30 US cities by 2017. As well as the US, the UK will also be trialing the vehicles in Greenwich as part of the $9 million project called Gateway, shuttling people to the O2 Arena. The finding comes amid reports that companies such as Google and Uber are working on technology to develop driverless taxis . Some will be on the roads where it's legal,' Corey Clothier, a strategist Comet LLC, who is running the trials told DailyMail.com. Passengers can set their destination on some of the vehicles by typing it into a map or using commands. A combination of radar, lasers gives the car a 360-degree 'view', with sensors linked to computer software able to 'see' and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights. 'It's interesting to see people's reactions', said Clothier. 'Very few are nervous, or noticeably nervous. 'We've had interesting reactions from non-riders too. We were in the Silicon Valley and we had hundreds of people step in front of the vehicle to see what would happen.' 'The vehicles stopped. We've never had an accident.'

1347,d20a452567cf0f0c3ac57d2ba19eaaf69b1edc37,"A teenager had to close her mother’s shop to detain a shoplifter for three hours until police arrived – only for them to let her off with a caution. Katie Cope, 17, said she feared being assaulted by the agitated woman after police repeatedly refused to give her an estimated time for their arrival. She had to close the shop and put down the electronic shutter after the thief became abusive towards other customers and kept trying to leave. Let down: Store owner Eve Cope with assistant, Sol, who helped Katie to detain the shoplifter . When police finally got to the vintage clothing store, they said the stolen knickers, which had been reduced to £1, were not worth enough to prosecute. Yesterday, Katie and her mother Eve Cope, 60, told of their fury at the police’s response and accused officers of giving a ‘green light’ to shoplifters by merely cautioning the 66-year-old culprit. Mrs Cope, who has owned the Baklash store in Nottingham city centre for 33 years, was away when the thief struck last Thursday. She said: ‘I was really scared for the safety of my daughter. I do feel like the police let the shoplifter off. ‘This must be the fifth time I have had to deal with a shoplifter in the last few years – on one occasion I was even assaulted and hit my head on the pavement outside the shop when I tried to stop a thief. ‘The police asked me to drop the case against the girl responsible because she offered to apologise and pay for the shirt she stole.’ Katie said: ‘It is a ridiculous situation. I could have been in trouble if the woman had reacted aggressively to being held in the shop. ‘I’m really disappointed with the police. Letting this woman off just gives a green light to shoplifters.’ A male shop assistant called Sol was working with Katie when she spotted the shoplifter leaving with a pair of knickers in her handbag. Katie stopped the thief outside the shop at 2.50pm and led her back inside while Sol dialled 101 – the police non-emergency number. Katie said: ‘I was not going to let her go. She didn’t apologise and when police eventually got here she lied about her age and her name three times.’ Officers arrived within nine minutes after Mrs Cope, pictured outside her store, made a formal complaint . When Katie was still waiting for a police response three hours later, Mrs Cope rang to make a formal complaint and officers arrived nine minutes later, at 6.10pm. Mrs Cope said: ‘They told us that because the underwear was only priced at £1, they would not prosecute. ‘I told them it wasn’t just the value of the knickers at play here, but the fact we had lost three hours of trade by having to close. They just told me I would have to pursue a civil case for damages against the thief if I wanted to take it further.’ Local councillor Michael Edwards called the incident ‘concerning’. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: ‘We aim to provide the best possible service to anyone who calls to report a crime, but in periods of high demand response times can be affected.’ Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping said: ‘I am sorry that the business in question had a problem. Shoplifting is not as much of a problem as it used to be.’ However, figures from crime data analysts, UK Crime Stats, showed that in Nottingham there was a rise in shoplifting offences from 288 last February to 324 this February.","Katie Cope, 17, detained a shoplifter in her mother's vintage clothing store .

11280,9d638b59ac14906611d05b609780b78e1492c9b0,"Momentarily, he looked his age. Having struck his second shot 163 yards to within six feet of the pin, Jordan Spieth stood over his ball on the 18th green. History was assured. He wasn’t going to three-putt from there, so whatever happened this would be the lowest 36-hole score in the history of the Masters. He wanted it to be more than that, though. The best it could be. The exuberance of youth was kicking in. Spieth missed. For the first time around Augusta, he made a mild mis-step. He wheeled away, hopped a little, almost coltish in his frustration. He marched back to his ball, prepared to tap it in. Except it wasn’t a real tap-in. There was a bit still to do. And at that point, Spieth checked. He stepped away. He marked his ball. He let Henrik Stenson play. He did the sensible thing. Spieth always does the sensible thing. That is part of his wonder. Jordan Spieth walks off the 18th after carding a 66 to finish 36 holes at a 14-under 130 . Spieth leads Charley Hoffman by five strokes, matching the largest halfway lead in Masters history . Some might think that makes him boring. It doesn’t make him boring. To shoot 14 under, the lowest two-round score at Augusta, and equal to the best 36-hole score recorded at a major championship, isn’t boring. We may be watching a sporting phenomenon. A performance as breathtaking as Tiger Woods’s arrival in 1997. There will come a time when such comparisons no longer seem like hyperbole. If Spieth repeats his achievement at the Hero World Challenge in Florida last year, perhaps, when he led from wire to wire and recorded a score of 26 under par. Those numbers are unlikely though. As the tournament committee set out ever more fiendish pin placements in the next two days to preserve the dignity of the famous greenery, his scores are bound to fall. Against that, it will be a lot harder to chase Spieth’s total than just maintain it. Modern courses have, of course, been Tiger-proofed before — but in the short term Augusta may need to be Spieth-proofed, too, if his scoring stays stable. This was his sixth round as a professional here and his worst score is level par. He has been in the top three players in five of those six, too. ‘I was a bit out of my comfort zone, at the moment on the 18th,’ Spieth confirmed. ‘I was going to have to work around Henrik’s line — and I just thought if I step away I am definitely going to make this putt, so that was the only way I could miss. ‘I have to work to control those things the next two days. If I can shoot 14 under then a lot of other players could shoot 14 under, so I have to be ready for that and to match their scores now. The stress levels can get pretty high. Still, it’s pretty cool any time you can lead the Masters and to set a record is awesome.’ Spieth broke Raymond Floyd's 36-hole scoring record by a stroke and blitzed the first 36 holes . At the age of 21 and playing in his second Masters, Spieth looks in complete control . Billy Horschel, Spieth’s playing partner, had wished for an imaginary tape recorder at the end of the first day. Horschel deadpanned that he needed a device that replayed the message ‘Nice hole, Jordan’ as they stood on every tee. Nothing changed overnight. Many had Augusta pegged as the venue where Rory McIlroy would complete his personal grand slam in 2015; instead, this Masters may go down as the moment where he was placed in the threatening shadow of a young Texan gunslinger, now in the vanguard of an American revival. Up ahead of Spieth, Ernie Els laboured valiantly to stay in touch. It was a salutary reminder of the need for good timing in any sporting career. At the age of 25, as McIlroy is now, Els won his first major, the 1994 US Open. He was considered capable of dominating the sport for the next decade, and he won it again in 1997. By that time, however, a 21-year-old called Tiger Woods had announced his arrival at the 1997 Masters. The era of Els never materialised. McIlroy may have achieved more and younger than Els, and Spieth may not be the ice-cold winning machine Woods was at his age — but he has done a damn good impression of one over the first two days. Already in the record books, Spieth has many more landmarks in sight these next two days. The record for birdies here stands at 25 from Phil Mickelson; Spieth already has 15. His course management was outstanding. Spieth took Augusta on, yet remained entirely in control. It helps that he is exceptional, yet strangely unspectacular. As Graeme McDowell pointed out recently there are better drivers, better chippers, better putters — and the statistics bear this out — but none who do all three as well as Spieth. He might not have the best game; but he has the most complete. There were tiny aberrations — he found the pine straw twice on the back nine — but they were rare. Most of the time, he was consistency personified, picking out the best line, the best lie, the most advantageous position on the green. When he dallied with a bunker on the par-five eighth, his third shot was so perfect that he sunk a two-foot putt for birdie. Spieth made 15 birdies through two rounds as he blazed his way around the Augusta fairways and greens . The young Texan pumps a fist to celebrate a birdie on the 13th during his sensational round . ‘That was special, even for you,’ said Horschel’s caddie Micah Fugitt. It was a masterful display, the work of a wise head not a callow college boy. It isn’t just that Spieth doesn’t think like a 21-year-old. At the 15th, a par five and a good birdie opportunity, he sensibly laid up, and then made four. Even when he missed, he missed cute. He has absorbed a lot from his mentor Ben Crenshaw, a fellow Texan and Augusta expert. Asked about ‘Ben’s advice’ on Thursday, Spieth sweetly replied: ‘Do you mean Mr Crenshaw?’ There wasn’t a hint of irony in his response. Had he stayed in school, he would be studying for his finals right now. Instead he is fast approaching £10m in career earnings and on the brink of a first major. The next Tiger? That is a heap of pressure to drop on young shoulders. The idea that McIlroy is without a serious challenger has been truly debunked. When Spieth shot 63 to win the Australian Open at Royal Sydney, the conditions were windy and inhospitable. McIlroy said he could have played the course a hundred times in those circumstances and not made Spieth’s score. Geoff Ogilvy claimed it may well have been the finest 18 holes of golf seen in Australia. Where do Spieth’s first 36 holes stand in the annals at Augusta? Ray Floyd played the previous best 36 holes — 13 under par — in 1976. Spieth now has that record, as well as that of the youngest player to hold the 18-hole lead. Like McIlroy’s US Open victory at Congressional in 2011 this could see a grand rewriting of the record books. He has barely put a foot wrong. Nice hole, Jordan? Seriously, dude, name one that wasn’t. Spieth recovers from among the trees at 13, and his caddie Michael Greller has to hand it to him (below)","Spieth set a new Masters scoring record with a 14-under 130 through two rounds at Augusta National .

It only stopped when the girl started crying. Sacked: Madeline Luciano, pictured, was fired after she allegedly allowed pupils to write nasty words about one of their classmates on the board . But Ms Luciano - who was fired following an investigation - claims far from encouraging them to bully the girl, the exercise was supposed to teach them they should be kinder to each other. The 40-year-old has now launched court action against the city's education department as she attempts to get her licence back so she can work in another school. Ms Luciano told the New York Daily News: 'I want justice. I was just trying to stop the bullying. This is insane. I don’t deserve this.' The investigation into the incident, which took place last June, revealed how the girl had been targeted by bullies many times before. On this particular day, they had hidden her book bag. 'Injustice': Ms Luciano claims she was actually trying to teach a lesson about the evils of bullying . Ms Luciano then asked the students to write down any problems they had with the girl - and it ended with pupils shouting insults across the classroom and them being written on the board. But the teacher, who has worked for New York's education department since 2010, says things were never meant to go so far - and she told off the teen writing the nasty comments on the board.

It has been revealed that starving competitors on the survival show hunted and killed an endangered crocodile during filming after the show's bosses mistook it for a more common species. Male competitors had not eaten for two weeks when they tracked down and killed what the show's producers thought was a common caiman - a small, relatively common reptile. Scroll down for video . Male competitors on Bear Grylls' show The Island had not eaten for two weeks when they killed what producers believed was a common caiman - but later discovered was an endangered American crocodile . However, suspicions were raised when the animal slain on camera appeared larger than usual, and it has now turned out to be an endangered American crocodile. While the animal's exact numbers in the wild are unknown, conservationists are in agreement that illegal hunting and habitat destruction have left it critically endangered. Most U.S. states in which the creature is native, along with islands in the Caribbean, parts of Mexico and South America have all passed laws protecting the creature. According to The Sun, the show's producers had surveyed the islands used during the show before contestants were set loose, trying to identify any animals which would be off-limits for hunting. A spokesman for Channel 4 said the islands used in the show were surveyed to establish what wildlife lived there before filming, and it was not known that American crocodiles (pictured) could be found there . While several caimans had been discovered, it was not known that the American crocodile also lived there until the competitors found it. The episode in which the animal is killed on a remote island off Panama, central America, will be screened tonight. A spokesman for Channel 4, which produced the show, said: 'This was a genuine and regrettable error. Prior to filming experts were consulted to ascertain species on both islands and the American crocodile was not known to be in the area or on the island. 'The relevant national environment agency are aware of the incident and have granted a licence to replace the animal which has now been done.'","Male contestants had not eaten for two weeks when they killed reptile .

Manchester City may have big plans to revamp the team in the summer, with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri among the high-profile casualties, but what if Liverpool reel them in over the next six matches? City are four points clear and have a superior goal difference, which equates to five, yet undoubtedly they are vulnerable. For a team playing this poorly no run-in is easy and matches against the much-improved Aston Villa and even Queens Park Rangers can no longer be viewed with certainty. Yaya Toure (centre) has been a shadow of the player who fired Manchester City to last season's title . Manuel Pellegrini (second right) trudges off the pitch after Manchester City were beaten by Crystal Palace . Future opponents Swansea City and Southampton have little to play for — yet neither did Crystal Palace. The long-term plan is plain: Pep Guardiola, at his convenience, probably in 2016. Yet where will City be by then? An overhaul of playing personnel is due, but there has been scant evidence Manuel Pellegrini or director of football Txiki Begiristain are adept at identifying replacements. Eliaquim Mangala was supposed to be a different class to Joleon Lescott, but the Premier League’s most expensive defender cannot command a place in the team; Stevan Jovetic is no Carlos Tevez; Fernando no great upgrade on Gareth Barry or Nigel de Jong. Toure is in obvious decline, but his influence on City’s two title winning seasons was huge. Can Pellegrini and Begiristain be trusted to find a replacement capable of Toure’s impact? Not on the evidence of their recent signings. Jesus Navas? Martin Demichelis? Even Fernandinho is not as good as he was at Shakhtar Donetsk. The powers that be at City are waiting for Pep Guardiola to leave Bayern Munich for Manchester . And what if City are caught and condemned to the Europa League? What happens to this lavish rebuilding plan then? Take away the Champions League money and City’s financial capacity is not really much greater than Tottenham’s. Pellegrini has performed weakly this season and keeping him on another year while marking time for Guardiola is a giant gamble. Roberto Mancini got City into the elite in the nick of time with the financial fair play regulations about to be introduced. Locked outside, City’s capacity to improve would be severely limited. Would Guardiola even come in those circumstances? Great manager he may be, but not one that has shown any burning desire to work off the same budget as Everton.","Man City currently occupy final Champions League place .

Jose Mourinho’s side could face Sydney  at the ANZ Stadium on June 2 - days after Spurs’ fixture against the same side. The Blues are holding ongoing talks with Sydney bosses and, should they agree terms, are expected to fly out on the Wednesday after the Premier League season ends. Chelsea are set to follow Tottenham’s lead and take part in a post-season friendly Down Under in June . Manager Jose Mourinho has been discussing post-season plans with the Chelsea board . The concept of fulfilling commercial obligations straight after a Premier League campaign is appealing to clubs, giving them room to manoeuvre during pre-season. Chelsea are expected to arrive in Australia as top-flight champions and the 83,000-seater arena would almost certainly sell out. The plan for a post-season tour has been discussed for a while, with Mourinho saying earlier this month: 'If we win the title, I think we’ll go on an after-season tour, play a couple of matches in some destination where people will be very enthusiastic to have the Premier League champions. 'It’s something we are thinking about, a good way to celebrate. Not a victory parade but a trip, a week where we play a couple of matches but, at the same time, can be together without the pressure of winning every match, without the pressure and tension of the last weeks of the Premier League. Harry Kane's whereabouts in June is undecided, although it appears he will play for England Under 21s . May 27: Chelsea expected to fly out to Australia . May 28: Sydney FC vs Tottenham . June 2: Sydney FC vs Chelsea (TBC) June 7: Republic of Ireland vs England . June 11: Copa America begins . 'We can also relax and go to holidays with that good feeling. But we still have nine matches to play. [The chairman] Bruce Buck and the board are talking with me about destinations. We want to go somewhere where people are enthusiastic to have a club like Chelsea.' Tottenham play on May 28 and a week before England's friendly away in Ireland, meaning international stars could forgo the trips. The whereabouts of Harry Kane remains up in the air that week after the very public indications he will be selected by England Under 21 boss Gareth Southgate for the European Championships in Czech Republic. The timing does raise questions as to whether or not Chelsea's South American contingent will join them, with the Copa America due to start on June 11. Filipe Luis, Ramires, Oscar and Willian are all expected to be selected by Dunga's Brazil, with Colombia to pick Juan Cuadrado. Chelsea are set for a hectic summer schedule. They are also expected to travel to the USA for two weeks in mid-July as part of the International Champions Cup and be back at Wembley in time for the FA Community Shield on August 1, should they win the Premier League. Mourinho said on Friday: 'The players that go to a tournament like Copa America have a certain number of days to go. Friendlies have a certain number of hours to go. 'Players who play qualifiers for the Euros, they have another number of hours. We are going to respect that as we did all season. No problems, for sure. When our players have to be here, they will be. That's for sure.' Chelsea will face Sydney FC at the ANZ Stadium days after Tottenham play the same opposition . Manchester United had looked primed to join the growing list of clubs participating in post-season jaunts, but instead announced they are to play in America in July. Manager Louis van Gaal expressed his disappointment at last year’s gruelling schedule before that deal was ratified. Liverpool and Manchester City will play in Australia in July ahead of the 2015/16 campaign.","Chelsea to face Sydney FC at the ANZ Stadium on June 2 .

In the springtime, the shops are full of new season clothes that are just waiting for a sunny day but still unsuitable for the ever-changing British weather. Cotton dresses, cut-off mini skirts and denim hot pants all need to wait until at least June for an appearance. Scroll down for video . Lily Melrose is a fashion blogger who has 137,000 followers on Instagram . So what to do if you want to embrace summer style now, but keep away from the shops for another couple of months? Fortunately, there are still plenty of crafty ways to keep your wardrobe current - and all you need is a pair of pliers, a glue gun and some scissors. UK stylist and blogger Lily Melrose has come up with 15 style hacks to transform your 2014 wardrobe into 2015 style, without breaking the bank. Read on to find out the DIY tips for making your clothes up to date... Lily models her updated dress, complete with necklace collar . Evening glam . Perfect for a night out with the girls, give your trusty little black dress a gorgeous splash of glam that captures this season’s catwalk style by using an old necklace to create a stunning jewelled collar effect. Use pliers to separate the necklace into individual jewels, position the pieces around the collar and simply use a glue gun to attach, instantly adding ‘the glam factor’ as seen on Matthew Williamson and House of Holland collections this Spring. Off-duty pastels . Dip-dye is big news this season and a subtle dip-dye effect will add a burst of spring colour to any daytime look. Hand dye and a bowl is all that is needed to update last year’s festival staple, the white vest. Carefully dip the first few inches of the vest into your favourite pastel shade and leave to dry. Lily’s top pick is on-trend blush pink and styled with jeans and a leather jacket for a casual daytime look. Lily shows you how to update sunglasses . DIY designer shades . As the sun comes out, it’s time to dust off last year’s sunglasses. For an effortless, high-impact update, take some jewels or artificial flowers and carefully glue these to the brim or sides of the sunglasses in a symmetrical design. Already a  trend seen on the faces of Dolce & Gabbana and Prada catwalk models this season, this simple and cost-effective design will ensure you’re one step ahead of the fashion set . Dare to bare (your knees) You don’t need to buy a new pair of jeans to sport this season’s biggest denim trend – plus worn jeans are softer too so they’re much easier to customise. Cut a rip just above the knee cap and then pull out threads and distress the edges for the perfect laid-back cool look. Team with patterned tights underneath for a fresh take on this look. Hair jewelry . The Les Copains label was among those adorning catwalk hairstyles with statement jewellery, but you don’t need to buy them. Carefully attach old necklace jewels (broken down by pliers) onto hairgrips with glue and leave to dry, to turn a boring hair day into a cute one. Headphone sparkle . In fact, embellishment can be used to spruce up any accessory – take inspiration from Dolce & Gabbana’s bejewelled headphones and add some sparkle to your commute by adding old jewels and diamantes to the outside of your Beats headphones. Fringed boots is a key look for 2015 . Seventies chic . The Seventies look has exploded on to the high street from the catwalks, but instead of going all in with flared jeans and heavy prints, try wearing existing key items in a new way. Channel the vibe with a high waisted skirt (bonus points if it’s the classic Seventies shade of camel), teamed with a tucked in black polo neck. For extra fashion points, cut off the sleeves of the polo neck as seen in Topshop this season for an easy update for spring. Crystal slippers . Take last year’s slipper shoe and update for this season by attaching some studs to them for an edgy spring look. The soft fabric makes it easy to attach them; pierce the fabric with each stud and fold them flat on the inside using pliers to keep them secure and comfortable. Cropped logo T-shirts: Nineties style has been in for a while now, but this year expect to see classic logo T-shirts updated for spring with cut off sleeves and cropped to the waist a la Daisy Lowe. No sewing needed – just don’t be afraid to take your scissors to your favourite old T-shirt! Fringe feet: Fringing has been big for a few seasons now, but this season the must-have is going to be fringing on your feet; take a simple suede tassel in the same shade as your favourite boots and attach using a few stitches. Use thread in the same shade for a seamless look. Faux fur gilet . Spring is the hardest time to style as the weather is so changeable; dig out last year’s faux fur cropped jacket from your wardrobe and unpick the sleeves to create a gilet to throw on over T-shirts for warm, breezy days. Rita Ora was wearing a faux fur gilet in New York in February . Instagram . Pinterest and instagram are the perfect ‘virtual wardrobe’; when you get compliments on outfits or try something new, take a snap and post them to create your own style bible that you can refer to at any time. Just by looking through you’ll probably see something you haven’t worn in a while that’s worth digging out! Colour pop . The classic white shirt is a style staple, but you can add a bit of spring colour simply by swapping the buttons for bright alternatives. Just a few hand sewn stitches can change the entire look with subtle hints of colour. Personalised pumps . With even Prada getting in on the act, personalised footwear is everywhere right now. But you can create your own one-of-a kind look by using a paintbrush to paint fabric dye onto the panels of your favourite Converse or plimsolls. Celebrity dye job . One way to revive hair for the new season is with an ombre style. Rather than transforming your locks with an all-new shade, why not choose pink tips. The flash of colour will refresh locks for spring. Lily Melrose supplied her style hacks in association with Gallo Family Vineyards Moscato.

Adam Barker, who served 13 weeks in prison after admitting to making indecent images of children in 2012, is an equal shareholder in Handles for Forks Ltd, which manages and distributes his father's work. The company made £501,319 profit in the year to last June, which will be split with his sister Charlotte, 53, and brother Laurence, 46. Adam Barker (left), pictured with parents Joy and Ronnie in 1997, will share more than £500,000 this year in royalties, according to new accounts . It also has assets of nearly £1.2million, the Daily Mirror reported. The previous year the company made around £300,000 and Barker would have similarly received a one-third share. The 47-year-old was first arrested in 2003 during a dawn raid on his house. 1,675 images and videos depicting child pornography were discovered by officers. He went on the run for eight years - during which time his mother and father both died - and was reportedly living in Hungary. At the time he left a note for his parents, which read: ‘Dear Mummy and Daddy. Some time ago the police came to my house looking for images of under-age children on my computer. I was arrested. ‘I must apologise for being foolish and thank you for being great parents. Rather than wait and find out what will happen, I will go away. You must understand that I won’t be able to contact you for quite some time.’ The 47-year-old served 13 weeks in prison after admitting to making indecent images of children in 2012 . He is an equal shareholder in Handles for Forks Ltd, which manages and distributes his father's work. Above, Ronnie Barker is pictured with Ronnie Corbett . The whereabouts of the part-time actor, who appeared in Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, remained a mystery until he handed himself in to a police station in west London. He was jailed at lsleworth Crown Court in October 2012 for 12 months after admitting 20 counts of making indecent images of children, 17 of which were of pre-teen boys. Judge Rosa Dean, sentencing at the time, told him: ‘Your offences contributed to the degradation and continued abuse of children.’ But he served only 12 weeks because he had already spent three months on remand.","Adam Barker is an equal shareholder in Handles for Forks Ltd .

9723,653e3f2bc9e41a53ced7d4b1149c01b191848d94,"The mother of a three-year-old boy who was killed when a runaway two-tonne trailer mounted the pavement and crushed him to death is being targeted by online trolls who blame her for the incident. Donna Hussey, 32, has also been branded a 'bad mum' by trolls on Facebook over the death of her son Freddie - who was killed when a huge portable cabin came loose from a passing Land Rover. Mrs Hussey, who had just dropped her eight-year-old son Archie to school, was helpless as the runaway trailer mounted the pavement and crushed young Freddie against a wall in Bedminster, Bristol. Donna Hussey, 32 (right), has been targeted on Facebook and branded a 'bad mum' by trolls who blame her for the death of her son Freddie (left) - who was killed when a runaway trailer crushed him against a wall . A passing lorry driver tried to resuscitate Freddie and paramedics arrived within minutes, but he died shortly afterwards at Bristol Children's Hospital. Police investigators found the trailer had not been correctly attached to the Land Rover but driver Tony Davies avoided prison after admitting causing death by careless driving. His sentence infuriated Mrs Hussey and Freddie's father Scott, 37, who blasted his punishment of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service as a 'joke'. Mrs Hussey said her torment has now been worsened further by hateful Facebook trolls who have bombarded her with messages calling her a 'bad mum' since the tragedy in January last year. The insurance worker said: 'Something that has been difficult was the reports that Freddie was behind me (when it happened) and that was not true. 'I've had lots of hurtful comments and people Facebooking me, sending abusive messages that I was a bad mum. 'I see little kids a few steps in front or behind their parents every day. 'I have to live with what happened. 'I loved that little boy and I love Archie so much. Those kids were my world and I just never would have put them in harm's way. 'I just want people, before they start making nasty comments, to really think about how they are with their children and how they feel it is right to judge. 'It has been very hurtful and we have already gone through hell.' Freddie (left) died after being hit by a trailer which cameoff a Land Rover driven by Tony Davies (pictured outside court last week, right). Davies, 38, was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving . A trailer used as a workmen's cabin came off Davies' Land Rover and crushed Freddie to death against a wall . This is the trailer coupling which failed, allowing the trailer cabin to detach from the Land Rover in Bristol . Bristol Crown Court heard last week how the tow hitch between the Land Rover and the trailer was not secure because the position of its handbrake prevented it from being locked down. Prosecutor Anna Vigars said Freddie had been walking behind his mother, playing in the puddles and laughing and joking when the accident happened. They had just dropped off his brother at Parson Street Primary School when the portable cabin detached, travelling around 10 or 12 car lengths before mounting the pavement and crushing the toddler against a wall and telegraph pole. The trailer is used on building sites as an area for workers to relax and contained a kitchen area with a table and basic facilities, as well as a toilet. Davies, 38, was spared jail after admitting causing death by careless driving but Freddie's family slammed the 'lenient' sentence and have started a petition to get mandatory safety checks for towing equipment. When Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC handed Davies his sentence, Mr Hussey branded him a 'f****** joke' and called Davies a 'f****** t***'. Mrs Hussey agreed, calling the sentence 'disgusting, no justice at all' before shouting at Davies: 'I hope you rot in hell. You are scum. He was a beautiful little boy.' Mr Hussey revealed how he has suffered panic attacks since the tragedy and lost his HGV driving job because he cannot get behind the wheel. Freddie's parents Scott and Donna Hussey denounced the sentence of a six-month driving ban and 200 hours of community service given to Davies as a 'f****** joke'. They have set up a petition calling for tougher rules . Mrs Hussey (pictured left with her husband Scott) said she has received 'lots of hurtful messages' over the death of Freddie (right) who was killed in by the runaway trailer in Bedminster, Bristol in January last year . He said: 'If the law can change then that would be great it is not all for nothing, but we also want to get the sentence changed. 'We feel we have been wronged by the justice system. 'We thought we would get justice but we are back at day one again. It is hard and it feels the past 14 months have been for nothing.' His wife added: 'Since the sentencing we feel we are back at day one again, we don't want to get out of bed and carry on. 'We feel like we lost our little boy for nothing. 'He was giggling at me and then out of nowhere the trailer came, it all happened so fast. I couldn't get to him in time and these moments will live with me forever. 'I saw things no one should ever see. I know we did nothing wrong but still go over what ifs.' In a moving statement, she earlier described the impact on her family of Freddie's death, and said: 'We have all suffered with nightmares and flashbacks and we have had to put Archie to bed most nights crying as he is missing his little brother, his best friend and playmate and cannot comprehend how or why this has happened. 'Archie doesn't want to watch cartoons on Saturday morning any more, as this is something he used to do with Freddie. 'It is devastating as a parent when you have already lost one child and your other one talks about killing himself so he can be with his brother. He is only eight years old. What can you do or say? 'Archie and I have started therapy. I get flashbacks of the incident and events before and after every day. I have woken up at night screaming as I relive what happened in my dreams and it is terrifying.'","Donna Hussey, 32, targeted by trolls online over three-year-old son's death .

4921,9d6bcc42a1032baf04e45267eaa144fb670a0a3c,"Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure is a dream target for Inter Milan, according to general director Marco Fassone. The Italian giants are keen to sign the 31-year-old this summer, a player Inter coach Roberto Mancini knows well having guided him from 2010 until 2013 at the Barclays Premier League club. Gazzetta dello Sport claim Inter are prepared to submit an offer of 60million euros (£43million) for the Ivory Coast international, who is under contract with the Blues outfit until June 2017. Serie A side Inter Milan hope to sign Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure (front) this summer . Inter general director Marco Fassone fears City's asking price and Toure's wages could be too much . 'Who doesn't dream of having a player like him? Toure would give our midfield line something that we are lacking,' Fassone told Italian sports newspaper Tuttosport. 'But his wages and City's asking price might be a big obstacle.' Toure has scored seven goals and set up one more in 22 Premier League appearances this term for City. Inter are also working on new deals for their Argentina forward Mauro Icardi and Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic. Icardi is Inter's top scorer this season with 15 goals and is tied to the Nerazzurri for a further three seasons, while Kovacic, who is a reported target of Liverpool, is under contract with inter until June 2019. Inter striker Mauro Icardi is on the verge of signing a new contract with the club, according to Marco Fassone . Mateo Kovacic, pictured celebrating a goal against Cagliari, is also in talks over an extended deal . 'We are almost there with respect to Icardi's contract extension,' Fassone said. 'We want to keep him just as we want to keep Kovacic. 'We will evaluate with great care (their) eventual offers. 'It's clear that if we want to sign three players (this summer) we will need to evaluate those that will depart.' Inter's priority right now is to tie Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovic to a long-term contract. Goalkeeper Samir Handanovic, pictured against Napoli, has been linked with Roma and Manchester United . The Slovenia international has been linked with Roma as well as Manchester United and becomes a free agent next season. 'Handanovic's renewal is an issue that we must resolve at once,' Fassone said. 'We need to understand what he wants. 'We cannot go into next season knowing that our goalkeeper's contract expires.' Inter are currently 10th in Serie A with 10 league games remaining.","Inter Milan are hoping to sign Manchester City's Yaya Toure this summer .

1579,2586dff7ef4374a9bd4a0cf94a76c009d235b58a,"A coroner has warned of the dangers of bedside cots after a seven-week-old baby choked to death. Grace Joy Roseman died after she managed to manoeuvre herself over the edge of her crib and a ‘safety ridge’ cut off the oxygen to her brain. West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield yesterday issued a report expressing concern over the Bednest Bedside cot, which was endorsed by the charity National Children’s Trust, saying urgent action must be taken to prevent future deaths. Tragic: Seven-week-old Grace Joy Roseman died after she managed to move over the edge of her adjustable cot and a 'safety' ridge cut off oxygen supply to her brain, West Sussex Coroner's Court heard . Concerns: The webpage of the luxury cot which has been linked with her death. A coroner has called for the 'dangerous' cot to be pulled from the shelves after the newborn baby girl was strangled . Grace’s mother Esther put her down for a nap at around 8.30am on April 9. The cot – which is designed to be placed next to a parent’s bed – has a moveable panel on one side which can be folded down, leaving a ridge just 7cm high. Mrs Roseman returned about 90 minutes later to find Grace unresponsive, lying with her head over the edge of the cot. The provisional cause of death was given as asphyxia, caused by the ridge cutting off the oxygen supply from Grace’s windpipe. In her report, Mrs Schofield listed a number of concerns surrounding the cot. She said: ‘In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths ... should another baby be placed in the prone position and left with the side incompletely lowered again in one of these cots, another death could occur. 'If the cot’s side is not safe to be incompletely lowered or for the cot to be tilted more than 5cms then it should be questioned as to whether these should be options available at all.’ Grace’s father Gideon, who lives with his wife in Haywards Heath, West Sussex, said: ‘There are no words that can describe how we feel about the loss of our beautiful little Gracie. Grace's parents told the inquest 'We are eternally grateful to the doctors and nurses at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath (pictured), who did everything possible to try and save our little Gracie' ‘She was just starting to develop her own little personality and was always smiling. We would not wish any parent to have to go through such a devastating loss.’ The National Children’s Trust has pulled the cot from sale and stopped all pending orders going out. Susie Parsons, interim chief executive of the charity, said: ‘This is a tragedy and our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the Roseman family at this time. ‘We have immediately suspended all sales and despatches of the Bednest crib until the completion of the inquiry and we will also undertake our own detailed and thorough review.’ Bednest, which is based in Stratford-upon-Avon, is still selling the cribs on their website from £249. The page boasts an endorsement from Jools Oliver, the wife of celebrity chef Jamie. Mrs Oliver writes: ‘We love the Bednest ... I love the way it is so close to our bed the sides are really easy to pull down. ‘Easy and definitely eliminates the fear of falling asleep with them in your bed and suffocating them as they lay safe next to you but in their own safe little cosy bed.’ A spokesman for Bednest told MailOnline: ‘We are greatly saddened and extend our heartfelt condolences to Grace’s parents. ‘We are doubly upset to hear this news, since the concept behind Bednest’s design is first and foremost about baby health and safety and came originally from highly experienced neo-natal nurses. ‘It is not the case that the coroner has called the cot “dangerous” and asked for it to be withdrawn. ‘The coroner has highlighted that all safety guidelines for the correct use of the crib are laid out in the instruction manual, but due to a growing second-hand market for our Bednest cribs, these instruction manuals may not be passed on. This may be, sadly, what happened with Grace’s crib. ‘We are now considering displaying basic instructions on the side of the crib itself.’","Seven-week-old Grace Roseman died in adjustable Bednest Bed Side crib .

3210,9ce7d85d97b8d75d99dd0b2da835738338d10b3a,"Posters telling Muslims not to vote in the election were plastered across an area of Cardiff . Posters telling Muslims not to vote in the election were plastered across an area of Cardiff yesterday. They read: 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah.' Posters were stuck on lampposts and bus stops across the Grangetown suburb telling the Muslim electorate: 'Islam is the only real workable solution for the UK'. Cardiff Council have begun removing the posters, dubbed 'chilling' and 'threatening' by locals. The full message on the poster reads: 'Democracy is a system whereby man violates the right of Allah and decides what is permissible or impermissible for mankind, based solely on their whims and desires. 'This leads to a decayed and degraded society where crime and immorality becomes widespread and injustice becomes the norm. 'Islam is the only real, working solution for the UK. 'It is a comprehensive system of governance where the laws of Allah are implemented and justice is observed.' Local parent Greg Pycroft, 36, was with his two-year-old son when he came across 20 posters plastered on his walk to nursery yesterday. The Welsh Government worker  said: 'It was quite chilling and threatening to see these posters.' Cardiff Council says any religiously motivated or offensive stickers will be removed as a priority. Grangetown councillor Ashley Govier said: 'People have a right to vote and that needs to be respected. Grangetown is a very tolerant area but it's got to go both ways. 'If they do choose not to exercise their right to vote, that's their business but we're trying to encourage people to do so and this is unhelpful and not very nice.' Mr Govier said the council's response has been immediate and 'pretty incredible'. Bosses at Cardiff Council (pictured) say workers have begun removing the posters, dubbed 'chilling' and 'threatening' by locals . Sahar al-Faifi, of the Muslim Council of Wales, said the anti-voting posters were put up in response to the voter registration campaign in Cardiff for the last three months. Miss al-Faifi added: 'The reason behind these posters is we have had such a successful voter registration campaign across mosques in Cardiff. 'We have been doing it every Friday for three months to encourage worshippers in an unpartisan way to participate in their civic duties. 'Most mosques were on board and the hateful people behind these posters do not represent us. 'The mosques believe they can be part of the political process of this country.' The groups Muslim Council of Wales, Hope Not Hate and CitizenUK have been leading the voter registration action across the Cardiff suburbs of Cathays, Grangetown and Butetown.","Posters were stuck on lampposts and bus stops in Grangetown suburb .

7507,4e1008548af1ee2130d73d93f12de591cda9c92a,"The Apple Watch is officially going on sale today - but none of its stores will have them in stock . Apple launches its first smartwatch today - but anyone turning up to buy one from a store will be disappointed. For although the Apple Watch is officially going on sale, none of its locations will have them in stock. Instead, consumers willing to shell out between $549 to $17,000 - for the gold edition - have to pre-order the watches online and wait for their arrival until June. Usually, Apple launches generate long lines outside stores. But analysts believe the company feared the lines might be embarrassingly short and so opted to launch the watch with more of a whisper than a bang. In fact, despite the high price and some skepticism that consumers are eager to adopt a new generation of wearable technology, pre-orders have far exceeded expectations. As a result, the company's initial production run is simply not large enough to ensure that watches will be available in stores from today. Analysts believe Apple is sitting on some two million pre-orders and that sales could top 20 million this year. The watch includes a host of personal trackers, including a heart rate monitor, and is being billed as a personal doctor that will help users to lose weight and improve their health. However, Apple also wants it to be seen as style statement and fashion accessory, with customers able to choose from any of 38 variants depending on the case and watch strap. As a result, limited supplies have been given to six designer outlets around the world, which will apparently be sold to a few select customers by appointment today. The launch of the watch into stores is being handled by Apple retail chief, Angela Ahrendts, who is very familiar with the world of designer labels. She told Apple staff via video message earlier this week that the decision to make the watch only available through online orders is because demand has exceeded supply. In it she said: 'We know that you have been bombarded with questions from customers. 'Luckily, the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We know they are excited about the Watch ...but there are a lot of questions about availability and timing etc. 'Last week we announced that due to the high global interest and the initial supply that we would only be taking orders online right now. 'This was not an easy decision, and I think it's really important to remind every single customer that this is not just a new product for us, this is an entirely new category.' Apple chief executive Tim Cook pictured giving a presentation on the Apple Watch in San Francisco last month . A spokesman said: 'Our team is working to fill orders as quickly as possible based on the available supply and the order in which they were received. We know many customers are still facing long lead times and we appreciate their patience.' Stuart Miles, technology expert and founder of website Pocket-lint.com, said: 'I think the watch will follow the same lines of success as the iPad did five years ago.

3325,5588d9eecfe630bbe8ac41600cd377c0bc810670,"(The Hollywood Reporter)Stan Freberg, whose freewheeling comic career in advertising garnered him worldwide acclaim and whose satirical entertainments abounded on TV, the radio and on records, has died. He was 88. Freberg died of natural causes at a Santa Monica hospital, his son and daughter, Donavan and Donna Freberg, confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. ""He was and will always be my hero, and I will carry his brilliant legacy forward as best I am able,"" his son wrote on Facebook. The godfather of humorous and irreverent commercials, Freberg lampooned cultural institutions and described himself as a ""guerilla satirist."" The New York Times dubbed him the ""Che Guevara of advertising,"" and years later, ""Weird Al"" Yankovic called him a major influence on his career. ""Very sad to say that one of my absolute all-time heroes has just passed away,"" Yankovic wrote on Twitter. ""RIP Stan Freberg. A legend, an inspiration, and a friend."" Freberg also was known for his musical parodies. ""Wun'erful Wun'erful,"" his 1957 spoof of ""champagne music"" — on which he collaborated with orchestra leader Billy May — lampooned ""The Lawrence Welk Show."" He also parodied Johnnie Ray's hit ""Cry,"" which Freberg rendered as ""Try."" (Ray was quite angry until he realized Freberg was fueling sales of his record.) The Los Angeles native had hit records of his own, including ""St. George and the Dragonet,"" a 1953 send-up of the series ""Dragnet."" His recordings were so popular that he landed his own radio program in 1954, ""That's Rich."" Three years later, he presented ""The Stan Freberg Show"" on CBS Radio, where he regularly mocked commercials by advertising bogus products. Hollywood Reporter: ""Mad Men's"" return . He won a Grammy Award in 1959 for best performance, documentary or spoken word for ""The Best of the Stan Freberg Shows."" Earlier in the 1950s, Freberg helped create and write the Emmy Award-winning comedy ""Time for Beany,"" also working with puppets and performing on the show. Its droll, off-the-wall humor appealed to fans including Albert Einstein. During Beany's early gestation, he and the other writers had no office, so they wrote in coffee shops at night as well as in an ""office"" in a condemned building. Not surprisingly, Freberg ruffled institutional feathers. Capitol Records balked at releasing his satires of radio-TV personality Arthur Godfrey and Ed Sullivan's variety show ""Toast of the Town."" Hollywood Reporter: ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" -- the untold story . Freberg disdained the hard sell. He created such classic comic ad capers as ""Nine out of 10 doctors recommend Chun King Chow Mein,"" and his Jeno's Frozen Pizza campaign featured the Lone Ranger and Tonto. He skewered the greed of the ad business in ""Green Chri$tma$, which criticized the over-commercialization of the holiday. In 1958, Freberg opened his own ad agency, Freberg Ltd. His slogan was ""More Honesty Than the Client Had in Mind,"" and he even had a corporate motto: ""Ars Gratia Pecuniae"" (Art of the Sake of Money). Freberg, whose inspirations were Jack Benny, Fred Allen and Norman Corwin, worked in cartoons for decades, starting in the 1940s. He provided the voice for Junyer Bear in the 1948 Chuck Jones Looney Tunes cartoon ""What's Brewin', Bruin,"" and he famously played the three pigs, the wolf and the singing narrator in another Looney Tunes classic, 1957's ""Three Little Bops."" He teamed often at Warner Bros. with the great Mel Blanc. Freberg also was the voice of Beaver in Disney's ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955). For the feature Looney Tunes, ""Back in Action"" (2003), he was heard as a baby bear. Survivors also include his wife, Hunter, and a granddaughter. ©2015 The Hollywood Reporter.

Guardiola managed to tear the left trouser leg of his grey garments during an incredibly exciting night for Bayern, who led their opponents 5-0 at half-time. The Spanish tactician's underwear was on show after the incident, and he joked after the Champions League clash: 'I'll have to buy new ones for the next match.' Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola ripped a hole during the Champions League match in Germany . Guardiola's underwear were on show after the Bayern boss managed to rip a small hole in his trousers . The excitement of a 6-1 win against Porto appeared to get the better of Guardiola's left trouser leg . Away from Guardiola's clothing, Bayern managed to book a place in the Champions League semi-finals thanks to goals by Thiago Alcantara, Jerome Boateng, Thomas Muller, Xabi Alonso and a brace from Robert Lewandowski. Porto went into the match with a two-goal lead following their 3-1 victory in Portugal, however they were swept aside by the Bundesliga giants.

11131,226e8811bb8b12773895eeb43645726bb6447764,"A telescopic tube that scans the lungs for cancer is being used by NHS doctors, cutting diagnosis time from days to just 30 minutes. When tumours in the lungs are suspected, patients can face a raft of tests and even surgery to find out if they have the disease, often resulting in an agonising wait before they start lifesaving treatment. Now doctors at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure. It even allows them to assess instantly the type and severity of the cancer. Scroll down for video . A finger-width flexible tube called an endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) allows doctors to see inside the lungs and take a tissue sample in one go. The procedure involves inserting the EBUS down the throat, guided by a tiny camera fitted to the tube. An ultrasound scanner attached to one end of the tube takes a scan while a small needle takes a tissue sample. Findings from a three-year trial at UCLH reveal that the method halves the time it takes between a patient’s first hospital appointment and for a decision to be made on the best course of treatment. EBUS patients wait an average of 14 days for a decision, compared with 29 days for those diagnosed via more conventional techniques. And as well as getting a quicker diagnosis, patients who have undergone EBUS survive for longer. Doctors at University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (pictured) are able to start vital treatment much sooner using a single procedure . They survive for 503 days after diagnosis, compared with 312 days for people assessed through more traditional methods. This is probably due to the fact that EBUS can more accurately diagnose the type of cancer involved and therefore the type of treatment needed. Consultant Dr Neal Navani, who has been testing the technique, said the results had been so impressive that he now hoped the procedure would be rolled out across the NHS. ‘EBUS routinely prevents the need for scans, tests and operations and speeds up the route to the correct treatment,’ he says. He adds: ‘The trial showed that the new procedure is quicker and better – it halves the time to the start of treatment at no additional cost.’ BBC political editor Nick Robinson announced that doctors found a tumour on his lung earlier this year . More than 40,000 people are diagnosed with lung cancer in the UK every year, yet the disease is notoriously difficult to treat as it is often spotted at a late stage. The BBC’s political editor Nick Robinson announced earlier this year that doctors had found a tumour on his lung, and he has since undergone a successful operation to remove the growth. Diagnosing lung cancer can be a challenge – X-rays are not always definitive as it is hard to distinguish between cancer and other lung conditions. A biopsy is the traditional way to check conclusively whether a patient has lung cancer. However, obtaining a tissue sample can be difficult as lung cancer often spreads to the lymph nodes in the chest and these are hard to reach. This means that surgery may be necessary before a doctor can be sure that the disease is present, resulting in a wait for results. The health of many cancer patients can deteriorate because these delays mean they are not started immediately on lifesaving treatments such as chemotherapy. By comparison, the EBUS allows doctors to look directly into the windpipe and breathing tubes, while the ultrasound scanner can check the lymph glands in the centre of the chest for cancer. One patient who received faster treatment thanks to the EBUS technique is retired sales worker Maureen Mullen. The 65-year-old from Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, had already had a tumour removed from her lung in September 2013, and underwent a double mastectomy the following March after being diagnosed with breast cancer. Then in June last year, she began to feel breathless while on holiday in Spain. When she returned home to Britain, she was given the devastating news that she had a new lump behind her breastbone. Her doctors could not be sure what type of cancer it was without investigating further, so they recommended she have the pioneering EBUS procedure. ‘They said I was a very sick lady,’ reveals Maureen. ‘My consultant explained the procedure to me and I was taken into the operating theatre and sedated. It was all over so quickly – there were no side effects from the procedure, no dry mouth or sluggishness, and I felt really positive about the whole process.’ The EBUS revealed Maureen had small cell carcinoma, a form of lung cancer that can spread quickly, and she needed a course of chemotherapy immediately. She started treatment the next day, and after six months of chemo, the tumour was gone. ‘The EBUS was brilliantly efficient,’ adds Maureen. ‘By 4pm that day, my cancer had been diagnosed and the appropriate chemotherapy was ordered for me to start the next day. ‘Had I had a traditional biopsy, who knows where I’d be.’","When tumours in lungs are suspected, patients can face a raft of tests .

3910,973b628ec67cb2ad2cd146443bd7b649a181323b,"Crawling commando-style underneath an open-sided Land Rover, I came virtually nose to nose with a 4,500lb horned rhino. I tried to slow my breathing as she looked straight at me. I needed to be calm to take my shot. There were three other rhinos with her and, let's be honest, they're not called a crash of rhino for nothing. I raised my camera and began to photograph what could soon become an extinct pachyderm. The luxurious Ulusaba Game Reserve is  in South Africa's Sabi Sands and is Sir Richard Branson's private reserve . Thankfully the female found my scrawny presence of absolutely no consequence, and instead wandered off in search of tastier herbivorous options. I was with my mate James and we laughed awkwardly as we climbed back into the vehicle. My mum – Sky TV presenter Kay Burley – was sitting statue-still on board, having adopted her best nonchalant expression, but she wasn't fooling either of us. The holiday at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands, was my reward for graduating. I have been on safari before but this was different. I'm an amateur car photographer and wanted to swap taking photos of Ferraris and focus instead on the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo, the prowl of a glorious leopard or a close-up of a fearless rhino. We achieved all of them. Kutner came face to face with three rhinos, along with documenting the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo and the prowl of a glorious leopard . Just the day before, we had tracked the crash of rhino on foot. With 1,000 rhinos killed by poachers in South Africa last year alone, they are increasingly difficult to view. Danny, our brilliant tracker, who could find a spelling mistake in a dictionary, had eventually located them, but with dusk fast approaching we reluctantly headed back to the Land Rover. The African bush is not a place to be on foot in the dark. We should know. We'd spent the earlier part of the day up close and personal with a pride of lions. Our ranger, Trevor, steered the Land Rover as close as he dared without disturbing the big cats. The lioness, who could have taken any one of us out with a casual swipe of her front paw, looked in our direction, checked her cubs and allowed us to stay. Trevor, also a photographer, whispered advice on appropriate settings for my Nikon D600 to achieve the best results. Heading back to the luxury accommodation at Cliff Lodge, a two-bedroom apartment within Rock Lodge (Mum described it as glamping but with solid walls, luxury furnishings, soft sheets and a chef to conjure up our favourite food), we talked about all the other animals we wanted to see, if possible. Alexander Kutner with mum, Sky TV presenter Kay Burley, at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands . Trevor said he and Danny would try but couldn't promise anything. Nevertheless, given the conservation, ecology and anti-poaching work being carried out by Ulusaba and adjoining camps, we were feeling confident. The following day we found ourselves slap bang in the middle of a herd of buffalo, mean-looking guys who glare at you as if you owe them money. Danny, who will happily track on foot for lion, leopard, elephant and rhino – four of the Big Five – makes an exception for buffalo. Alexander said a lioness looked in his group's direction, checked her cubs and allowed them to stay . Trevor started up the engine and we moved on. Pausing at a watering hole, we were delighted to see two young male elephants wandering towards us. They made their way into the water and proceeded to perform for us – a photographer's dream! We returned to the lodge to relax and sort through the hundreds of photos we'd captured. Chef served up kudu burgers for lunch. We'd seen plenty of these handsome antelope during our morning game drive… and Mum decided to pass on that meal. Ulusaba means 'place of little fear'. That's because the koppie where Rock Lodge sits provided the ancient Shangaan warriors with the perfect lookout point . Trevor wondered what else we'd like to see. 'Cheetah, please,' we cried. He took us on a long, bumpy drive to the wide-open plains where cheetah can run free in their hunt for food. They are extremely rare in this area of the Sabi Sands and, despite hour after hour of tracking, there were no paw-print clues. However, Trevor had one last surprise. Danny heard the call of a honey bird and a solitary warning from an impala antelope. These led him on foot to a pair of leopard cubs frolicking up a tree. There is no sighting quite as magical as a leopard, and six-month-old cubs are the perfect age to provide incredible images of their playful behaviour. Eventually, with a heavy heart and my camera packed away, we left the African bush. Until the next time...

Budi - who spent the first year of his life trapped in a chicken coup - was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable. Indeed, video footage captured at the International Animal Rescue's orangutan center in Indonesia, shows the duo throwing adoring glances at each other as they share a dinner of fruit. At one point Jemmi nuzzles Budi's side and purses her lips, as if she is blowing him a kiss. He then promptly performs the same gesture back at her. Love at first sight: Budi - who spent the first year of his life trapped in a chicken coup - was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable. Two peas in a pod: Indeed, video footage captured at the International Animal Rescue's Orangutan Rescue Centre in Indonesia, shows the duo throwing adoring glances at each other as they share a dinner of fruit . Mimicking: At one point Jemmi nuzzles Budi's side and purses her lips, as if she is blowing him a kiss - he then promptly performs the same gesture back at her . Carers at the rescue center say that 15-month-old Budi and Jemmi have developed a 'beautiful friendship'. Along with eating meals together, they apparently enjoy playing around on the ropes and branches of their enclosure. A spokesperson added: 'If Budi is taken into the day enclosure first he will keep looking back for Jemmi and, if left on his own, will cry until his new friend joins him. 'At the end of the day they both make their way back to their shared hammock where they spend the night together.' Budi was dying from malnutrition and too weak to move when the International Animal Rescue discovered him in Borneo, Indonesia, last December. Rescued: Budi also had a tough start to life Budi the orangutan and was found (pictured) lying on his back in a wire chicken coop without the strength to sit up . Tragedy: This photo, taken at the time of his rescue, shows the 10-month-old with a thin blanket in his cage for comfort . Along with being kept in a confined space, his owner had never given him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him - leaving his tiny limbs swollen and bent. Earlier footage showed him crying in pain when one of his carers gently turned his body or lifted him to sit up. But thanks to intensive treatment and care from International Animal Rescue's veterinary team, he made a remarkable recovery. Meanwhile, eight-month-old Jemmi was orphaned when her mother was killed and then illegally sold as a pet. Despite their rough beginnings, the wonderful new footage shows the orangutans' transformation from frail and helpless babies into inquisitive animals, now strong enough to swing from trees. They look extremely comfortable in each other's company as they sit side-by-side. It's hoped that their friendship gets them both used to being around other orangutans so they can hopefully be released into the wild some day. Strength: The tiny orangutan didn't have the muscle strength to open his mouth when he was first rescued from a life of neglect . One of many: International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia . Alan Knight, CEO of International Animal Rescue, said: 'As they start to form bonds with each other and then with other orangutans in baby school, they will learn from each other how to behave in the forest and gradually shed their dependence on their human babysitters.' 'We couldn't be happier to see how well Budi is getting on with his new playmate. 'This first meeting is a milestone in the development of both babies.' International Animal Rescue are keen to stress that Budi's story is not an isolate case and there are 'countless' orangutans currently suffering from neglect in Indonesia. The charity is currently caring for 83 orangutans who were being kept illegally as pets. The primates of all ages are now undergoing rehabilitation so they can eventually be released back into the wild. Mr Knight added: 'People are being very generous in their response to Budi's story and I would urge everyone please to keep on supporting us. 'The more people give, the more orangutans we can rescue and help on their journey back to a protected place in the forest where they belong.'","Budi was introduced to Jemmi less than a month ago and now the two apes appear to be inseparable .

6032,d61cce600e562cd583d828e71892d30026736ba0,"The Milan Derby used to be Italian football’s biggest attraction. A host of world stars, two unwavering sets of supporters and a fierce rivalry meant AC Milan and Inter could always guarantee a spectacle. It was certainly the case in April 2005 when a hail of flares rained down from the stands on to the San Siro pitch - flooding the stadium with smoke and forcing German referee Markus Merk to abandon a virulent Champions League quarter-final. On Sunday, they meet once more against the backdrop of a Champions League quarter-final week. This time, however, interest has barely stirred. Inter Milan pose for a team photo ahead of their Champions League quarter-final against AC Milan in 2005 . AC Milan (pictured against Schalke in same year) has changed dramatically since their glory years . Starting XIs from the Champs League quarter-final second leg, April 12, 2005 . (4-2-3-1): Toldo; J Zanetti, Cordoba, Materazzi, Favalli; C Zanetti, Cambiasso; Van der Meyde, Veron, Gonzalez; Adriano. Starting XIs from the Champs League quarter-final second leg, April 12, 2005 .

(4-3-3): Diego Lopez; Abate, Mexes, Paletta, Antonelli; Poli, De Jong, Van Ginkel; Honda, Menez, Bonaventura. Marco Materazzi and Rui Costa watch on while the match was stopped because of flares thrown on the pitch . The 2005 clash – widely remembered for the chaotic scenes in which Brazilian goalkeeper Dida was knocked to the ground by a flare - was the second time in two seasons the sides had met in the knockout stages as the pair threatened continental dominance to add to their monopoly on Serie A. European success did follow in the form of one title apiece – Milan lifting the trophy in 2007 and Inter followed suit in 2010 – but both have seen their stock dwindle severely in the past few years. The pair have vacated the Champions League scene and their form in Serie A suggests they won’t be rejoining Europe’s elite any time soon. Milan - Europe’s most decorated club - are 15 points off the Champions League pace in ninth. Inter are a point and place further behind. Failure to qualify for next season – when the San Siro plays host to the final - will see both sides absent for the second year in a row. Never before has Europe’s biggest competition gone consecutive campaigns without any representation from Italy’s second city. For now, supporters have the derby alone to look forward to next term. While the rivalry remains as strong from those clashes a decade ago, the current crop of talent at both clubs does not. The San Siro would morph into a Pantheon on previous derby days – with Ronaldinho, Kaka and Luis Figo all gracing the Derby della Madonnina. Each a former World Player of the Year. AC MIlan goalkeeper Dida was hit by a firework during the Champions League quarter-final at the San Siro . Kaka, a former world player of the year, celebrates after scoring against rivals Inter 10 years ago . The AC Milan players embrace Jaap Stam after his goal in the Champions League derby match . Seven World Cup winners – past and future – took to the pitch when the side’s met in that Champions League quarter-final second leg. What Inter’s sporting director Piero Ausilio wouldn’t give for even an ounce of that quality in today’s side. ‘If players want to be worthy of this shirt, they must play better,’ he blasted on the club’s website after an embarrassing home draw with beleaguered Parma at the beginning of this month. ‘We are already working with Roberto Mancini to prepare Inter of the future. This is why I say we are evaluating who is worthy of wearing this jersey and who is not.’ Mancini’s reaction to the draw was to cancel his squad’s Easter break and haul them in for extra training. There is belief that with the former Manchester City boss back at the helm a corner can be turned. However, Financial Fair Play rules, coupled with a lack of revenue from European football, means it will have to be negotiated without the full backing of Indonesian owner Erick Thohir. Mancini was in charge during the Nerazzurri’s most fruitful period of recent times, winning three consecutive Scudetti along with two Coppa Italia titles between 2004 and 2008. Inter Milan were booed off the pitch after a disappointing draw with bottom-of-the-table Parma this month . 2004/05: 54,150 (2nd highest in Serie A) 05/06 51,444(2nd) 06/07 48,248(1st) 07/08 51,215(2nd) 08/09 55,431(2nd) 09/10 56,195(1st) 10/11 59,484(1st) 11/12 45,664(2nd) 12/13 46,654(1st) 13/14 46,246(1st) 14/15* 33,189(6th) *after 16 Milan home games and 14 Inter home games. 2004/05: 63,521 (1st highest in Serie A) 05/06: 59,499(1st) 06/07 46,292(2nd) 07/08: 56,906(1st) 08/09: 59,731(1st) 09/10: 42,951(3rd) 10/11: 53,916(2nd) 11/12: 49,359(1st) 12/13: 43,651(2nd) 13/14: 40,061(4th) 14/15*: 37,237(3rd) *after 16 Milan home games and 14 Inter home games. AC Milan players look dejected during a Serie A match against Sassuolo in January . ‘To come back to Inter is the biggest challenge,’ he told CNN at the beginning of April, six months after retaking the hot seat in November last year. Speculation suggests that the 50-year-old may look to his former club in a bid to breed another successful side, with Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri both sounded out as potential summer targets as Inter look to rebuild. Keeping hold of key squad members will be just as important to Mancini’s vision though – with the futures of striker Mauro Icardi and goalkeeper Samir Handanovic both far from certain. If there is a silver lining for Inter, it’s that their own woes pale in insignificance when compared with Milan’s troubles. The Rossoneri’s problems are not solely consigned to the field and relationships have fractured between the club and fans. Supporters boycotted the recent home game against Cagliari in protest at the way the club is being run and the refusal at board level to shed any light on its future – with details of a possible takeover by Thai businessman Bee Taechaubol so far withheld. Unclear, too, is the future of head coach Fillipo Inzaghi after a season stained with indifference. Like their city rivals however, there is ground on which the green shoots of recovery could grow. Roberto Mancini (left) and Filipo Inzaghi (right) are currently tasked with leading the clubs into a new era . Former AC Milan defender and captain Paolo Maldini could return to the club in a role upstairs . Plans for a new stadium, while not finalised, are being pushed, and talk of a return for club legend Paolo Maldini has also begun to gather pace. A change at boardroom level would almost certainly see the former centre back – who spent every one of his 24 years as a professional at Milan – offered his first role since retiring in 2009. The man himself would probably argue his reintroduction can’t come soon enough. ‘One of the sources of strength for a club like Milan, and for the few other clubs that are alike to Milan, is tradition,’ Maldini stated in a recent interview with Gazzetta TV. ‘Nowadays the real values of Milan are not being tended to.’ Those values are being called into question by fans of both clubs, as they continue to vote with their feet. Andriy Shevchenko and Hernan Crespo lead an exciting AC Milan team up front in 2005 . Average attendances at the San Siro have never been lower this century, dipping under 40,000 for the first time. In 2005, Milan boasted the best average in the league with 63,521, Inter taking second spot with 54,150. For 2015 those figures read just 37,237 and 33,189 respectively. Clearly then, there are still bridges to be built between the two fallen giants and their fans. It is their attention that matters more; much more than the gaze of onlookers from across the continent. ‘It won’t be the same derby of a few years ago,’ admitted Milan full back Ignazio Abate when interviewed by Sky this week. ‘But we won’t be lacking in motivation. We want to bring happiness to the club and our fans.’ This weekend’s derby provides both the Nerazzurri and the Rossoneri a chance to restore a touch of pride for supporters at the end of an arduous season. Restoring either side to its former glory will be a much tougher task still. Neither Inter MIlan or AC Milan look like restoring themselves to former glory anytime soon .","Inter Milan host AC Milan in a Serie A derby this weekend .

Frank Lampard’s role at Manchester City was always planned as being just a bit part player – but maybe the 36-year-old should have started more games. The 2-0 win over West Ham was his 38th appearance of the season but only the eighth time Manuel Pellegrini included him in the first eleven. Of those matches City have won seven – including the 3-2 over Bayern Munich – drawn one and not lost any, scoring 22 goals with just six conceded. Mind you, Lampard was always going to do well against The Hammers. In the last ten years he’s played 15 against his old club whose fans love to hate him, won 13 and drawn twice. Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini should have given Frank Lampard (left) more game time . 2. In an era when yellow cards get dished out to defenders like confetti, Phil Jagielka is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking on club duty. The 32-year-old did get his name taken during England’s 3-1 win over Slovenia in November, but the 1-0 win over Burnley was his 46th appearance in all competitions for Everton without getting into trouble despite being in the thick of the action, making 16 clearances. Jagielka is the only central defender in the Premier League not to have been shown at least one card. Phil Jagielka (left) is five games away from going a complete season without getting a single booking . 3. Tom Cleverley has found a steely edge since Tim Sherwood took charge at Aston Villa. While Fabian Delph and Jack Grealish were the creative stars in midfield in the 2-1 FA Cup semi-final victory over Liverpool, it was the former England ace who created the platform for them. Cleverley, still on loan from Manchester United and out of contract in the summer, made seven tackles – two more than Liverpool’s midfield put together. Tom Cleverley has found a steely edge since Tim Sherwood took charge at Aston Villa . 4. Marc Albrighton is emerging as a key weapon for Leicester in their fight for survival after spending most of the season as a barely used sub. The winger, who moved from Aston Villa on a free transfer last summer in search of regular football, has instead had to go until the last two games before boss Nigel Pearson has given him 90 minutes on the pitch. It’s been worth the wait. At West Brom last week he set up one of the goals in the 3-2 win, and he made four chances in the 2-0 victory over Swansea. Marc Albrighton looks to get past Nelson Oliviera during Leicester's 2-0 Premier League win on Swansea . 5. Tony Pulis always insists there is no additional incentive when he’s facing former clubs, but he still finds something extra in his teams against them. The 2-0 win for West Brom at Crystal Palace made it three wins out of three in reunion games without a goal conceded. Pulis got a 1-0 win when he was Palace boss against Stoke last season, the same score by which he beat Stoke again as West Brom boss this year before then going to Selhurst Park to end Alan Pardew’s run of four wins in a row. Tony Pulis shouts instructions to his players during West Brom's 2-0 victory against Crystal Palace . 6. At 37 years old Didier Drogba may not be the force he once was, but the Chelsea centre forward can still put in a shift for Jose Mourinho when he needs to. According to the EA Sports performance data the giant Ivory Coast star ran 6.7 miles in Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Manchester United, only a tenth of a mile less than the distance covered by rival striker Radamel Falcao. He also covered more ground at sprint speed than the Colombian, who is eight years younger than him. Didier Drogba covered more ground at sprint speed than Manchester United's Radamel Falcao on Saturday . 7. It’s been a long wait for Mesut Ozil to live up to his £42.5million transfer fee but the German World Cup star is now finding his true form at just the right time. The 26-year-old provided the assist for both of the Alexis Sanchez goals against Reading that took Arsenal into the FA Cup Final. It’s the second time this season he’s provided two assists in a game, both occasions coming since the start of March. Since the end of January when Ozil recovered from a knee ligament the Gunners have won 13 of the 15 matches he’s played. Mesut Ozil (right) was in fine form as Arsenal earned a place in the FA Cup final on Saturday . 8. With three points separating the top four clubs in the Championship, the race for a place in the Premier League is the tightest ever with two games left. And it’s not much easier for those trying to get into the top flight via the play-offs, either. Ipswich still need to win at least one game to be sure of finishing in the top six despite the 1-1 draw at Wolves taking them to 75 points – a total which would have been enough to guarantee a play-off spot in all of the last 14 seasons. Mick McCarthy's Ipswich still need to win at least one game to be sure of finishing in the top six . 9. MK Dons banked £5million for selling teenage midfield star Dele Alli to Tottenham in the January window but must be thankful they borrowed him back for the rest of the season. The 19-year-old took his haul for the campaign to 16 goals as got the last in a 6-1 demolition of Leyton Orient which means Karl Robinson’s side have now scored a club record 90 League One goals. If Dons get promotion they’ll be hoping to borrow Alli for another year to continue his development at Championship level.

Gary Johnson is in danger of having two relegations in one season on his CV unless he can get some points from Cheltenham’s last two games against promotion chasing Shrewsbury and at Wimbledon. The 59-year-old, in charge until February at Yeovil who are already doomed to drop out of League One, took a big gamble agreeing to try to rescue the Robins from losing Football League status after a chaotic season.

An eight-strong team have transformed more than 30 telephone booths in China’s capital city into a representation of Baymax, who has attracted a cult following in the country. Xiao Wang told The People’s Daily Online that he and his fellow graffiti artists – most of them design students – worked through the night to complete project ‘Beijing Warmth’. Phone booths in Beijing have been painted in the style of Disney character Baymax by graffiti artists . The team of artists painted 30 phonebooths in five hours overnight, calling the project 'Beijing Warmth' The loveable character Baymax appears in the movie Big Hero 6 about a young boy with a talent for robotics . Starting at midnight, they hit the streets in teams of four to spend five hours working on the phone boxes, using a total of 24 cans of paint. The 28-year-old said that living and working in Beijing is ‘very stressful’ — adding that he himself had witnessed three people take their own lives in just one month. ‘We chose this area due to the higher population of young people’, he said, adding he thinks the team’s work has improved the road. However their work may soon be removed, after a spokesman from the Haidan Municipal Committee said the phone booths - usually red - should not have been painted a different colour. Artist Xiao Wang said they wanted to raise a smile with burnt-out Beijing residents who live stressful lives . As the Baymax craze sweeps China, a flight school even has their teacher dressing up as the robot . An official from the Beijing Municipal Government said there were no set rules on how to deal with graffiti, and the response was different depending on the content. If the artwork was not offensive and colouring matched the surroundings then it could be allowed to stay, he added. 'Big Hero 6' won the Oscar for the best animated feature in February this year, and its popular character Baymax has a won big following in China after it was released in February. The film became the highest grossing Disney film in China, taking in more than $51 million. Trainee flight attendants at the Sichuan Southwest Vocational College have began dressing like the robot during their lessons, while another craze has seen parents making dumplings in the shape of Baymax to encourage their children to eat.

Wearing a striped grey shirt and black pants with a orange backpack flung over one shoulder, Anika Stanford arrived at Leeton Police Station on Thursday morning to meet with police officers. She left 45 minutes later with a detective in a silver sedan and was taken back to the home she shared with her son, Vincent, and another son, Luke. Ms Stanford is believed to have given police information which led them to a road in the  Cocoparra National Park, where they discovered Ms Scott's burnt remains on April 10, five days after she went missing. Scroll down for video . Anika Stanford (pictured), the mother of Stephanie Scott's accused killer Vincent Stanford, is assiting police with the murder case against her son . Vincent Stanford, 24, has been charged with the Easter Sunday murder of Ms Scott, who disappeared the weekend before her wedding to fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley. He will next appear in Griffith Court by video link on June 4 . Stanford moved to the Netherlands aged two or three with his mother and brothers, before returning to Australia later in his life. The family has lived in the Leeton area for just 14 months, where Vincent Stanford worked as a cleaner at the same school where the much-loved Ms Scott taught English and Drama. When Daily Mail Australia knocked on the door of the Stanford's Maiden Avenue home on Thursday nobody answered, but it was understood two people were inside at the time. Ms Stanford's visit to the police station comes after the beloved teacher's family buried her in an emotional funeral at the venue she was supposed to be married. The touching celebration of the teacher's life saw hundreds of friends, family, and mourners travel to Eugowra’s Eat Your Greens function centre, the place where she was supposed to marry her fiance Aaron Leeson-Woolley.

At the service her sister, Kim, shared humorous childhood memories of Ms Scott with the crowd and painted a picture of someone with a strong sense of who she was. 'Steph never cared what anyone thought of her,' Kim said. 'She had an easy way about her that meant she could get along with anyone.' Mr Leeson-Woolley looked visibly distressed throughout the service, held just outside the town of Eugowra in New South Wales' central west.

On the same day, the school used social media to reach out to staff, students and parents after their first day back after the school holidays. It had also been the first day on campus without the beloved teacher. 'Once again, whenever strength, unity, leadership and integrity is asked of the whole student body, Leeton High's students rise to the challenge,' they wrote.

Five hat-tricks have been scored in this match-up since the inception of the Premier League, one more than has been netted in Newcastle United vs Manchester United games. Whats more, their meeting in December at Anfield ended in an entertaining 2-2 draw after an injury-time equaliser from Martin Skrtel.

Fowler has scored two of the five hat-tricks that have been netted in Liverpool vs Arsenal fixures . This fixture's first hat-trick hero in the Premier League era was Robbie Fowler, who scored three times at Anfield in August 1994. His goals, with just four minutes and 35 seconds between the first and the third hitting the net, is in fact the quickest hat-trick in Premier League history. And it was Fowler again who scored a treble 16 months later. Just two days before Christmas in 1995, Fowler responded to Ian Wright's eight-minute penalty by scoring in the 40th, 59th and 78th minute to give the Reds victory at Anfield.

3678,7c9c9fd7a449360b15b0db6c3d2e323b4c3a0f91,"On Friday night I’ll be wearing Bath’s No 6 shirt for the second time in a Premiership game. The switch from midfield has worked for myself and the team, so I’m hoping I can carry on playing in the back row for the rest of this season. The change of position was a decision my head coach, Mike Ford, made after the Champions Cup quarter-final against Leinster. He phoned me a day after that game to discuss playing me in the back row to maximize my on-field minutes in our run home, to what I call ‘the big dance’: that’s the finals. He thought No 6 would suit the way we are trying to play as a team and also suit my personal strengths and I agreed. Sam Burgess is set to start at blindside flanker for the second time for Bath on Friday night . Bath head coach Mike Ford believes Burgess will make a bigger impact on the game from the backrow . Burgess is still adapting to the 15-man code with his ball-carrying technique coming under scrutiny . In league, for nine years, my game has been about taking short balls and looking for holes. At Bath, that is what our forwards do, so moving into the pack makes sense and allows me more time on the field, which is what I need to keep improving my union brain. We’ve got, hopefully, five weeks left in the Premiership and if all goes well I will stay at six, but I don’t want to be pigeon-holed. I’ve found that has happened a lot since I switched codes. Whether I’m playing at 12, playing at 13 or playing at six, to me, it doesn’t make much difference to my attitude. I’ve found only subtle differences between the positions. Despite enjoying playing at flanker, I have not given up on a centre spot in my future in the game. I had a go at six earlier in the season in a couple of A-league games, but obviously that is not the same standard. Now, I feel more comfortable at the breakdown than I did a few months ago and I’m even getting to grips with the line-out. Burgess began his union career in the centre but is set to finish the season as a back rower . I find myself on the ball more, but I was disappointed by a few dropped balls. I never seemed to drop the ball as much in league! We’re addressing that now — my technique going into contact can improve. In union, you can contest for the ball more in the tackle than you can in league, so I’ve had to adapt a bit. I was maybe leading with the ball a bit too much. Another subtle difference between the codes is that in union players throw spin passes whereas in league, I was used to end-over-end passes. Now I’ve played in two positions, it is interesting to compare them. When I was in midfield, I thought that being a back was tougher and now I am in the pack, I realise that the forwards are the ones putting in the hard yards, but I’m sure if I go back into the backline, I’ll change my mind again! It was a great experience to spend time with the England squad. Burgess makes a strong carry during Bath's European Champions Cup clash with Montpellier in December . It was fantastic for me to rub shoulders with those players and pick up a few tips. I didn’t go in there with any mind-set other than to be myself and enjoy spending time with players I wouldn’t normally get to sit down and have a brew with. Training was intense and I enjoyed it. You never know when the opportunity will come round again, so I just tried to make the most of it. Stuart (Lancaster) wants me to do well in the game and wants me to be around the top players in that environment as much as possible, which is great. The former rugby league superstar spent time with Stuart Lancaster's England squad during the Six Nations . He just told me to keep doing what I’ve been doing. Obviously he has some pretty tough decisions to make, but he was pretty straight-up with me about where I stood. He told me I wouldn’t be part of those Six Nations matches, but he was very happy with how I’m going. I was at the last game against France. It was a great day for the sport and showed how freely people can play when the situation allows it. The atmosphere was unbelievable and the other players I spoke to said it was probably the best atmosphere they had ever experienced at Twickenham. Burgess was recently linked with move back to the NRL with Manly where his brother Luke (pictured) plays . That’s why I’m here; to be around that sort of atmosphere and to test myself on the best stage. It would have been wonderful to be part of that game. At around that time there were rumours in Australia that Manly wanted me back in the NRL. My brother, Luke, is there and suddenly my name was being mentioned, but anyone who knows my personality knows that there’s no way I would go back until I have given it a very good crack in union. For now, I’ll keep giving my best in that Bath No 6 shirt. Sam Burgess is a Canterbury ambassador and face of the Since 1904 fashion collection.

6884,a5f4111c8859dca0b6910378b7f32eb6a2c63ff4,"Brentford are considering appointing Gianfranco Zola as their new manager at the end of this season. The Italian was at Griffin Park on Saturday for the draw against Bolton and spoke with Bees owner Matthew Benham. Current boss Mark Warburton is to leave the club next month after feeling his vision did not match that of Brentford, who are to implement a continental approach to their management structure. Brentford are considering Gianfranco Zola to replace Mark Warburton at the club when he leaves this summer . The Italian was manager of Watford for a little over a season beginning in 2012, and led them to the play-offs . Zola is best remembered for the seven years he spent at Chelsea, where he scored 59 Premier League goals . Zola is one of a number of candidates on the list to replace Warburton, with Benham also sounding out coaches from Spain and France. The owner wants to follow the lead of his Danish side FC Midtjylland, who are on the cusp of winning the Superliga, sitting 11 points clear at the top. In keeping with Benham’s want for mathematical modelling, Zola would need to agree to having a statistics man alongside him should talks go well. Warburton is leaving Brentford this summer because his vision for the club did not match the owners' Rayo Vallecano’s Paco Jemez was the initial favourite to land the job. Brentford could still win promotion to the Premier League in the coming weeks but have fallen three points beneath the play-offs with two games remaining. Zola was sacked by Cagliari last month after failing to win a game during his three-month stint in charge. They are primed to drop out of Serie A alongside Parma. But the former Watford head coach does have extensive experience of managing in England and would buy into the European way to start in west London. He also enjoyed a largely successful spell at West Ham for two years from 2008. Zola was sacked by relegation-threatened Cagliari last month after a winless spell in Serie A . Brentford are still in the hunt for promotion but are three points outside the play-off places .","Mark Warburton set to leave at the end of the season .

The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean. It was found in silt after the River Avon burst its banks between Bristol and Bath. The tiny copper coin, which is smaller than a penny, dates from the Iron Age almost 2,300 years ago and suggests there were links between the south west of England and the Mediterranean . On one side there is a horse’s head, while the other bears the image of the goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage. Experts have dated the coin to between 300 BC and 264 BC and say it came from the Western Mediterranean - probably Sardinia or ancient Carthage. The find suggests that the village of Saltford, where it was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times. On one side of the coin there the image of the Goddess Tanit, the chief deity of Carthage, (pictured left) while on the reverse is a horse’s head, pictured right . The find suggests that the village of Saltford (shown on the map with a red marker), where the coin was found, was on a major trade route long before Roman times . It is believed there was a ford in the area, which made it the only place to cross the river Avon at the time. One side of the coin shows an image of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit,  suggesting links between the south west and the Mediterranean . The coin is thought to be the oldest dateable evidence of human activity found in Saltford and the West of England. It suggests Iron Age links between the Mediterranean and the Bristol Channel, which the River Avon flows into around 15 miles (24km) away. Professor David Mattingly, an archaeologist and Roman historian at the University of Leicester said: ‘It’s really interesting to have a Carthaginian coin in Britain. ‘Suppose that coin was deposited close to its minting - at the time, there were no coins being used in Britain. It would have been quite alien to people. ‘We are very sure that horses were important at the time so that may have invoked a lot of interest back then. It’s a very interesting find.’ Phil Harding of the Saltford Environment Group, said that the coin’s significant because it is one of the oldest coins ever to be found in England. ‘Only eight of these have ever been found, always on ancient trade routes,’ he said. ‘We can’t believe it. We thought we would be writing the history of Saltford from the Roman times to now. ‘But now we have to go back to the Iron Age. It’s absolutely fantastic.’ Last July a hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins were found in a cave in Dovedale in the Peak District, where they had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years. It was the first time that coins from the two separated groups have been found buried together. Archaeologists discovered 26 coins, including three Roman coins which pre-date the invasion of Britain in 43 AD, and 20 other gold and silver pieces which are Late Iron Age and thought to belong to the Corieltavi tribe. Last July a hoard of Roman and Late Iron Age coins (pictured) were found in a cave in Dovedale in the Peak District, where they had lain undisturbed for 2,000 years . National Trust archaeologist Rachael Hall said whoever owned the cache was probably a wealthy and influential figure. 'The coins would suggest a serious amount of wealth and power of the individual who owned them. ‘Coins were used more as a symbol of power and status during the Late Iron Age, rather than for buying and selling staple foods and supplies. ‘...The situation of the cave can’t be ignored either. Could it have been a sacred place to the Late Iron Age peoples that was taboo to enter in everyday life, making it a safe place that would ensure that person’s valuables were protected?'","Tiny copper coin is dated to the Iron Age, almost 2,300 years ago .

4111,4995c1ac8c16b2cbb1cec77f721e2c4011c5d43f,"Beijing (CNN)Amid tight security, a Chinese court has convicted veteran journalist Gao Yu for revealing state secrets and sentenced her to seven years in prison. Gao, 71, immediately said she would appeal, her lawyer Mo Shaoping told CNN Friday. After a closed trial last November, the No. 3 Intermediate People's Court in Beijing had twice delayed handing down a verdict, giving Gao's supporters some hope that the authorities' apparent hesitation may lead to her acquittal and release. ""Today's conviction is mainly based on a forced confession that she had since retracted,"" Mo said. ""This is a totally wrong judgment that doesn't respect the facts or the evidence."" The government had accused Gao of disclosing a highly confidential ""Document No. 9"" issued by the ruling Communist Party leadership in 2013 to an overseas Chinese-language news organization, according to her lawyer. The document revealed the Party's ideological battle plan to counter advocates of constitutional democracy, banning public discussions on topics ranging from press freedom, civil rights to judicial independence. ""There is no defense against state secret charges in China, anything the Party or the government want to label as state secrets will be labeled and treated as such -- they can even do it retroactively,"" said Nicholas Bequelin, the Hong Kong-based East Asia director of Amnesty International. ""Her sentencing is in line with the very stern approach President Xi Jinping's team has taken on dissent, information control and challenges to the Party,"" he added. Beijing police detained Gao in late April of last year -- ahead of the sensitive 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown -- and state broadcaster CCTV soon aired her ""confession"" on national television. Expressing ""deep remorse"" in the video, Gao told interrogators she ""deeply regretted that her behavior had harmed national interests and violated the law."" Mo, her lawyer, said the authorities had extracted the confession by threatening her son's safety and released the police video to CCTV without her knowledge. He added the alleged recipient of the leaked document even publicly denied that Gao was his source. An outspoken journalist and press freedom advocate, Gao began her career as a reporter for the state-run China News Service in 1979 and, in recent years, had been writing columns for overseas Chinese-language publications. She was arrested after the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 and released more than a year later. She was imprisoned for another six years for leaking state secrets in 1993 -- though the government has never disclosed details of that case. Since Xi took power over two years ago, his government has jailed hundreds of activists across China despite rising international concern. ""We are in the midst of one of the most severe crackdowns on human rights activists,"" said Bequelin of Amnesty International. ""What the state used to tolerate, it doesn't tolerate anymore.""","Accused of leaking a document revealing Party's ideological battle plan to counter advocates of constitutional democracy .

St. Charles Parish Sheriff Greg Champagne says Cpl. Burt Hazeltine was directing school buses on US 90 near Louisiana Street in the town of Paradis, just west of New Orleans, when he was gunned down. A male suspect, later identified as former Transportation Safety Administration worker 56-year-old Paul Devillier, was arrested a short time later after a brief 'tussle' with officers.

Bloody crime scene: The ambush took place on US 90 near Louisiana Street in the town of Paradis, just west of New Orleans. A deputy is seen swabbing what appears to be blood from the door of Hazeltine's squad car . Champagne says at around 9.15am, the shooter pulled up to a convenience store , got out of his 2014 Chevy Silverado pickup and opened fire on Hazeltine, who was hit in the face, elbow and eye. One of the bullets reportedly penetrated his lung. Another bullet lodged behind his eye, and the 36-year-old law enforcement officer may be at risk of losing his sight. Hazeltine is believed to have returned fire, but it was unclear whether Paul Devillier was wounded. Champagne says Hazeltine was in stable but guarded condition at Interim LSU Hospital Thursday afternoon. Two nearby schools, R.J. Vial Elementary and J.B. Martin Middle School, were briefly placed on lockdown after the shooting. Devillier had two weapons on him at the time of his arrest. Police say he does not have a criminal record but they suspect he suffers from mental health issues. Road rage: Devillier allegedly got into a verbal spat with Hazeltine because the deputy refused to stop traffic and allow his 2014 chevy Silverado (pictured) to make a turn . Worried for their comrade: Authorities walk outside LSU Interim Hospital, where Hazeltine was listed in guarded but stable condition . Burt Hazeltine was alert as he was being transported to the hospital, and according to Sheriff Champagne, he even cracked a joke in the ambulance about his ordeal, reported NOLA.com. Despite his severe injuries, the sheriff said a nurse attending to Hazeltine told him he 'got lucky.' During a press conference Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Champagne revealed that before the shooting, Devillier got into a verbal spat with Hazeltine because the deputy refused to stop traffic and allow him to make a left turn onto Louisiana Avenue, reported Fox 8. According to officials, Devillier then went to his father's home and called the sheriff's office, claiming to be an NCIS agent and demanding to speak to Sheriff Champagne. He then drove back to the Time Saver convenience store and called over Cpl Hazeltine, who was still directing traffic. When the deputy approached Devillier’s truck, he spotted a gun on the dashboard, pulled his service weapon and demanded the drive show his hands. Survivor: Hazeltine, pictured left with his wife, Mandy, was in stable but guarded condition at Interim LSU Hospital. There is a concern he may go blind in one eye .

8003,a5e9c4440c4dd8a2fa3ab9620df7db85c216ee8d,"(CNN)Recently, Robert Kennedy Jr. was in Sacramento, California, to campaign against Senate Bill 227, which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations. In his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening, he decided to compare ""vaccine-induced"" autism to the Holocaust. He said, ""They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone,"" Kennedy said. ""This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country."" A few days later, he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the Holocaust. To many, it's sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the Nazis. In a statement, Kennedy said, ""I want to apologize to all whom I offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic. I employed the term during an impromptu speech as I struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism, which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families."" Robert Kennedy Jr. has apologized for the wrong things. First and foremost, vaccines do not cause autism. The two have nothing to do with each other. Second, he seems to think people with autism are ""gone,"" their lives ""destroyed"" and their families ""shattered."" Autism is not a death sentence. People with autism are not missing or destroyed. They are everywhere, trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman, missing or worthless. Kennedy's rhetoric is a problem, even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines. People who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach-based enemas. Others, believing autism functions as a death sentence, even kill their children. I am worried about the effect of having such a powerful, high-profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism. I reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment. Ari Ne'eman, president of the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network, wrote, ""Robert Kennedy Jr, who has engaged with autism only to spread lies, misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric, has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic Americans. While his father, uncle and many others in the Kennedy-Shriver family championed the rights of people with disabilities, he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo-science to question our humanity."" These are harsh words, but try to see the situation through Ne'eman's eyes. Not only is Kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory, but he's also suggesting that it's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic. The usual response to people like Ne'eman is that he is ""high functioning,"" but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals? Henry Frost, an autistic teenager and writer, is devastated by this focus on burden. Last year, he wrote a post to other autistic children: ""Know you are not a burden or trouble for being. You are a person who has every right to be. A family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted. The family is wrong. Not You."" Meanwhile, Amy Sequenzia, an autistic activist and blogger, wrote, ""I am very disabled, have most of the usual not autism but co-occurring conditions, seizures almost every day, but am happy, proud and accomplished, with the human supports I have. That's what is missing. Acceptance."" As children, Sequenzia and Frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as ""gone,"" by Kennedy. Clearly, both are very much present. The solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity. Michael S. Monje Jr., an autistic writer and editor with Autonomous Press, wrote, ""The neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude. It is a way for autistic people, as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology, to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that -- natural. The fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural, less worthy, or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world."" I wish Kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities, even as he defended the sacred status of the Holocaust. There is, though, one story from the Holocaust that he might do well to consider. The first group the Nazis systematically exterminated, in the infamous Action T4, were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities.  Thousands of children, adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers, laying the groundwork for the later, larger scale acts of genocide. Underlying Action T4 was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value. We fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity, not by fearmongering. Kennedy owes a lot of people another apology.","David Perry: Robert Kennedy Jr. compared autism to the Holocaust, wrongly tied it to vaccines .

I’m eagerly awaiting his response. I haven’t seen it yet. Andros Townsend scores England's equaliser in their 1-1 friendly draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday night . Townsend celebrates his strike with Tottenham Hotspur team-mates Ryan Mason (left) and Kyle Walker . In his column for skysports.com, Merson wrote: 'If Andros Townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody. We are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against United. 'The England manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked. Townsend and Kyle Walker were the worst two players on the pitch. 'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn’t get in the squad?' ‘He said when the squad was announced that I should be “nowhere near the squad”. It didn’t really annoy me, but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics. Hopefully I’ve done that as I always have.’ Merson had made his comments on Sky Sports when Roy Hodgson named the players for games against Lithuania and Italy. The 1-1 draw in Turin had not long ended when Townsend (below) tweeted to his 285,000 followers: ‘Not bad for a player that should be “nowhere near the squad” ay @PaulMerse?’ The Tottenham’s winger’s father Troy joined in, too, tweeting: “Oh ye of little faith #Merson get in.’ They could also have pointed out that Townsend’s screamer was his third for England, taking him level with Merson. ‘You can never stop proving things to people,’ said Townsend. ‘But I think every time I’ve put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice. I was a bit disappointed with his comments but I have come on the pitch and silenced them.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson (centre) criticised Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week . Harry Kane congratulates his Tottenham team-mate Townsend after the final whistle in Turin . Good-natured north London Twitter skirmishing aside, there will have been a few Spurs supporters who understood Merson’s point. Townsend’s form has been inconsistent, and having seen him come off the bench to score for England they will wonder why he cannot do it more often for Tottenham. ‘I can’t put my finger on it or tell you what it is,’ admitted Townsend, when asked about the contrast. ‘The (England) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s my best form but this is the best form I’ve produced this season. I have had a few injury problems but I’m over the worst of that. ‘I’m slowly building my confidence back to where it was and hopefully from now until the end of the season I can get more games for Spurs and England and get back to the football I was producing last season.’ After long-range goals against Montenegro and San Marino, Townsend enjoyed the one he flashed past Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday. It came from his weaker, right foot, against elite opposition and he made a beeline for Buffon after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir. ‘He is a top goalkeeper — one of the best to ever play the game — so to score past him I thought was no mean feat,’ said Townsend. ‘As soon as the whistle went, I thought I’d go and get his shirt because it is a real night to savour for me.’ Roy Hodgson was also impressed with Townsend after the Tottenham winger's fine goal after the break .","Andros Townsend scored the equaliser in England's 1-1 draw with Italy .

But for one woman, securing a job at the Pokemon Centre in Japan would be her dream come true. Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia of all shapes and sizes. Lisa's mother had to move to the smallest room in the house to make room for her daughter's collection . Lisa Courtney, of Hertfordshire, has spent most of her life collecting Pokemon memorabilia . Indeed the 26-year-old has amassed so many during her 17-year hobby, she now holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon items, having 25,000 of them spread around the home she shares with her mother, Sharon. 'I just love Pokemon so much - there's just something about it that brings joy to me every day,' said Lisa. Her fixation with the Japanese characters started at the age of nine when she saw a picture of the cartoon's protagonist, Pikachu in a Nintendo magazine. Her collection of the Nintendo franchise has grown so large that her mother  had to move from the largest to the smallest room in their house to make room for her vast array of cuddly toys, models, clothing, badges, flannels and posters. Lisa clinched the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia in 2009 when she had 12,113 items, but that hasn't stopped her from collecting more. The devoted fan even travelled to Japan when the 11th Pokemon movie was released to get hold of exclusive merchandise that wasn't available in Europe. Lisa Courtney searches for Pokemon items online at her home . Lisa Courtney owns the world's largest collection of Pokemon memorabilia . 'I went for the release of the eleventh Pokemon movie in an attempt to get some exclusive Shaymin merchandise - it was amazing,' she said. Despite having to sacrifice her bedroom, Lisa's mother and the rest of her family are very supportive of her obsession and even buy her more items for special occasions. 'The first toy I ever got was a large Psyduck plush toy from Japan - my mother and grandmother ordered it from a mail order company before Pokemon hit the UK,' she said. 'We had to guess what we were ordering because the names of the Pokemon hadn't even been translated into English yet.' For Lisa, Pokemon isn't simply a cartoon, the programme really helped her through a very difficult stage of her life.

It helped Lisa through horrific times when she was at school and was kicked in the head and the back. 'Every time she came home and was tearful she would go to Pokemon and she would be smiling. 'She would love to work in Japan at the Pokemon Centre - more than winning the lottery - that would be her dream!' Lisa appears on Collectaholics on BBC2 at 7pm last night . Lisa spends seven hours a week on the internet browsing for new Pokemon releases to buy and trade, she also visits car-boot sales  hunting for rare memorabilia to add to her collection. 'I try and get new merchandise as soon as the new characters come out - it's often difficult as they are only available in Japan and America or are too expensive,' she added. Despite trying to save money where she can Lisa does own one particular item that she is sure must be worth a fortune. 'My most valuable piece is my large Ho-Oh plush toy, it was a prize in Japan, only available in raffles and in their amusement arcades. I bought mine for £60 online.

Meet Seattle's rolling neighborhood of RVs, where each unassuming vehicle is a capsule home. The unusual format has been captured in a series of photographs by visual journalist Anna Erickson. Meet Bud Dodson, 57, and welcome to his home: An RV in Seattle's SoDo where he watches over the parking lot in exchange for a spot . No place like home: John Warden, 52, has turned his $200 vehicle into his home after his apartment burned down years ago . There are around 30 drivers that float in and out of this parking lot in the SoDo (South of Downtown) area of the city in Washington State. One might not notice them in the mornings as hundreds of workers in the nearby factories, such as Starbucks, park up and rush into work. But on the weekends, as the rabble flocks back to their beds, this unique group remains. John Worden, 52, has been living in his vehicle for years since his apartment burned down and he was left homeless. He told Anna his car cost $200, and doesn't drive very well. But for a home, it's just about enough. Though plan on the outside, it is a Pandora's Box inside, Anna tells DailyMail.com. 'It was scattered with trinkets that he had been collecting over the years,' she explained, 'and a pile of beer cans that he was saving to turn in for money.' For work, he panhandles while helping people find parking spaces at Safeco Field stadium, where he used to be a cook. People come and go for work in the factories nearby, but on the weekend it is just the RV-dwellers that area left . Daily life: Here Bud can be seen preparing himself a barbecue on the gravel outside his capsule home, one of about 30 in the community . Eclectic: While Bud's RV is organized and functional, John's is full of trinkets and belongings dating back years . Alongside him - most of the time - is Bud Dodson, 57. While some are forced to move about regularly, Dodson, a maintenance man, looks after the parking lot in exchange for a semi-permanent spot. His home has its own unique stamp on it. 'He had really made the RV his home and taken good care of it,' Anna described. 'It was more functional [than John's] and a cleaner space with a bed, kitchen and bathroom.' Whether organized or eclectic, however, each one is home. 'None of them seem to want to move on,' Anna said. 'It's not perfect but they seem pretty content. Move in, move out: Some have agreements to stay, but others have to keep driving around to find a spot . John works as a panhandler at Safeco Fields stadium, where he used to work as a cook . He is content with his life in between the usual confines of society . Personal: To many this may just seem like a parking lot but for these men it is a very personal space . 'Bud is very grateful, he said the parking lot owner is just such a nice guy to let him live like this.' She came across them when she stopped to ask a seemingly homeless man for directions. 'We got talking,' she said, 'and he mentioned that he lived nearby in an RV. I went round to look and there was a whole bunch of them.' Curious, she spent about two months returning to the spot, meeting with the community and building their trust. 'These RVs are their homes so it's a very personal thing,' she explained.","Around 30 people live a floating life in Seattle's SoDo (South of Downtown) area in their RVs .

Following the Malaysian Grand Prix 11 days ago Hamilton claimed his new deal with Mercedes, worth an estimated £21million per year, was '99.6 per cent done' and was now in the hands of his lawyers. But the fine print of the terms and conditions means the 30-year-old, who opted on this occasion - and for the first time in his career - to negotiate for himself without an agent, is becoming frustrated.

Speaking to Sky Sports News, Hamilton added: 'Obviously at the last race I said it would be done within a week. 'This is my first time negotiating myself and you don't know how many times I've had to read about 80 pages. 'It is so much reading and it is all in lawyer jargon, so it has been quite a pain in the backside to be honest.'

Huge, bloodthirsty crowds are seen in the desert clearing where the group of executioners made a display of hugging the blindfolded couple and telling them they were forgiven of their 'sins', before pummeling them to death with hundreds of fist-sized rocks. Shocking: The group of executioners made a display of hugging the blindfolded couple and telling them they were forgiven of their 'sins', before pummeling them to death with hundreds of fist-sized rocks . Brutal: The shocking images were taken in ISIS-held territory in the province of Homs and show the two accused men being savagely executed by up to four jihadis . Images of the horrific murder emerged on social media this afternoon and were hurriedly shared online by ISIS sympathisers who claim the photographs reveal the terrorists' compassionate side. The sequence of four images begin by showing two blindfolded men standing side-by-side in  a desert clearing while a group of ISIS gather alongside the on motorbikes. One of the two victims - who has curly hair, a thick beard and wears a black leather biker jacket - appears resigned to his fate as one of his soon-to-killers shoulders rests his hand of his shoulder. A second shot shows a close-up of the killers embracing the men and apparently forgiving them. The act appears to be genuine and there is nothing to suggest the victims mistakenly thought they had been pardoned. Their remarkably calm demeanor is instead likely to have been due to the men having been given a cocktail of medication to reduce their anxiety. ISIS is known to have used similar mind-altering drugs  both in filmed executions and when carrying out public amputations. A third image shows a huge crowd of young men and boys gathered in the desert clearing to watch the atrocity take place.

According to shocking arrest warrants and summons seen by Star magazine, the 44-year-old Golden Globe winner allegedly set fire to one pledge after viciously beating him and using a claw hammer to drag him by his genitals during a hazing ritual gone wrong. The documents claim that Hamm, 44, was eventually charged with assault in connection with the sadistic November 1990 initiation, but he managed to get the charges dismissed before he began his ascent to superstardom. Scroll down for video . College student: Jon Hamm is pictured here in the University of Texas at Austin yearbook for 1990 (left) - the same year he was allegedly involved in a hazing scandal at the Sigma Nu fraternity. The actor is pictured (right) this week . According to the explosive court documents, Hamm was in his sophomore year at UT-Austin when a prospective 21-year-old pledge was called to the Sigma Nu house at 2.30am. When he got there, according to Travis County Court documents, Hamm - who was then aged 20 - and other frat brothers ominously told him, 'It's going to be a long night!' The unidentified junior was then allegedly subjected to two hours of brutal physical attacks as part of his fiery baptism into the fraternity. The alleged victim told police that Hamm and other members hit him with a paddle 30 times and then lifted the pledge off the floor by his underwear, 'pulling it back and forth in a sawing motion', causing 'great pain'. The pledged then claimed that Hamm led him to a basement 'Pit' where he slammed the junior's face into the ground while he was doing push-ups and then allegedly stood on his spine with his full weight. Shockingly, after this, Hamm is then supposed to have set fire to the pledge's pants and refused to let him pat the flames down, but instead made him blow them out. Shame: The allegedly assault saw Hamm and seven other frat brothers set fire to a 21-year-old pledge and beat him with a paddle . At the end of the vicious hazing ritual, the pledge was taken to a part of the frat house called the 'Party Room' where Hamm 'hooked the claw of a hammer underneath his genitals and led him by the hammer around the room'. Allegedly not content with this, Hamm then went onto to break into another potential pledge's room that night and subjected him to a similar torturous initiation. However, the morning after, the mother of the first pledge was called to his room to find him 'hiding in a closet at his apartment, his buttocks and legs black with brusises.' Despit pleading with his mother not to go public, saying 'They'll come kill me!', she reported the incident to the police. High school senior: These pictures of Jon Hamm are from 1989, the year he graduated from John Burroughs School in Ladue, Missouri and one year before his admission to University of Texas at Austin . Early career:  Jon Hamm is pictured here on the 1996 show The Big Date - one year after he had his arrest warrant dismissed and six years after the alleged hazing incident . Huge hit: Man Men and the character of Don Draper has given Jon Hamm his biggest role to date - winning a Golden Globe for his work on the AMC series . Eight warrants were issued for Hamm and seven other frat members, which was shut down for a time after the alleged incident. Three members of Sigma Nu were sentenced to 30 days in prison for the hazing ritual and Hamm was eventually hit with hazing and assault charges in 1991. In the wake of the hazing incident, the Sigma Nu fraternity was shut down in 1990 after the pledge's mother made her son's alleged assault public by going to the police. In 1990, the AP reported that Sigma NU would close and that seven students were being punished after pledges were 'physically and psychologically attacked'. The-then national president of Sigma Nu, James Cherry, said that he was revoking the charter of its UT-Austin, saying, 'Basically, we're out of business on this campus'. 'But our fraternity was founded in opposition to hazing in 1869 and we will not tolerate any form of hazing today.' A warrant was issued for Hamm's arrest in 1992 but the actor reached a plea deal with authorities in 1995 and the charges were dismissed. He returned home to live with his family in Missouri and the actor - who recently emerged from a 30-day stint in a rehab facility - began his acting career. A friend told Star that although shocking, 'The hazing incident was an isolated incident in Jon's life. Since then, he's been strong enough to take steps to make himself a better person.' Hazing incident: Following the alleged assault of the 21-year-old pledge, the Sigma Nu fraternity at UT-Austin (pictured) was shut down . Recently, the Mad Men star has admitted that playing the complex role of Don Draper has taken its toll. In an interview he gave just weeks before he checked himself into rehab last month for 30 days, Hamm opened up about the effect that playing Madison Avenue ad man Don Draper had on his psyche. The 44-year-old star told Variety: 'Playing this guy does not come without its own difficulties, it’s not fun to live in this guy’s headspace year after year.' He added: 'People ask, ""What’s the difference between you and Don?"" Look, I drink, I get drunk. I’m not immune to that, . 'And (creator) Matt (Weiner) will tell you, the darkness in Don has not abated, it’s gotten worse year after year. It’s relentless. And it can be hard on you as a person. I love coming to work; I love the people I work with. But it’s been rough.' As he reflected on being offered similar roles and being typecast as the dark, brooding, alcoholic womanizing character, Jon revealed he wants to distance himself from that persona.","Mad Men star was charged with assault for November 1990 hazing incident .

The revered writer, who penned Shawshank Redemption and The Shining, slammed Warner Brothers in 2012 for dropping plans to make a movie trilogy and TV mini-series. Finally, three years later, things are back on track - this time with Sony. Finally: Stephen King has announced Sony will be putting his 'magnum opus' The Dark Tower in cinemas . These are just two of the eight novels which King spent over 40 years writing. The movie and TV version is said to mainly stem from the first novel, The Gunslinger (left), focusing on the lead character Roland . 'I'm excited that The Dark Tower is finally going to appear on the screen,' King said in a statement. 'Those who have traveled with Roland and his friends in their search for the Dark Tower are going to have their long-held hopes fully realized. This is a brilliant and creative approach to my books.' The eight-book series written between 1970 and 2012 follows a 'gunslinger' on his journey towards a tower. Describing his self-professed 'magnum opus', King said it combines the essences of the Wild West, science fiction, and Lord Of The Rings. Like J. R. R. Tolkien's celebrated trilogy, The Dark Tower has its own unique language. According to Deadline, the newfangled project has an entirely new script which focuses on the relationship between Roland and Jake in Gunslinger, the first book. A provisional script has been written by Akiva Goldsman (Cinderella Man) and Jeff Pinkner (Lost). Rumored leads: Javier Bardem (left) and Russell Crowe (right) are said to be interested in the lead role . Three years on, Javier Bardem and Russell Crowe are still rumored to be interested in the lead role. Sony chairman Tom Rothman said in a statement: 'There are few projects out there that compare with the scope, vision, complex characters and fully drawn world that Stephen King has created with The Dark Tower. 'I am a giant fan. And, as Stephen himself does, we love the direction that Akiva and Jeff have taken. This is a great opportunity for a director to put his or her stamp on a cool global franchise.' When Warner Bros dropped the deal - initiated by Universal - King told a press conference: 'The Dark Tower, to me, and I’m not unbiased because I’m the writer on this thing, but to me it looks like gold on the ground waiting to be picked up.'","Warner Bros slammed by novelist for dropping the deal in 2012 .

Red is the overwhelming colour across the Football League in terms of the party that governs clubs' constituencies. The Conservatives trail some way behind, while the Liberal Democrats have only seven clubs in constituencies where they hold power. So if  May's vote goes the same way as the one in 2010, Labour would leave their rivals trailing in this alternative election. The Football League's political colours, based on the party holding each club's constituency . Ed Miliband (left) can claim that 18 of the 20 Premier League clubs are in Labour consituencies; but Prime Minister David Cameron may be concerned at the Conservatives' lack of Blues in the top flight . Football has long been hailed as the game the working man enjoys watching from the terraces . Overall, Ed Miliband’s party has MPs in constituencies housing 55 of the 92 clubs in England’s top four divisions. David Cameron’s Tories have 29. Only one club falls into independent hands: Bradford West, which holds Valley Parade, voted Respect leader George Galloway as their MP in a 2012 by-election. At the top table, 18 of the 20 Premier League grounds are in constituencies held by Labour. Only Chelsea, who voted Tory, fittingly blue, and Burnley, where Lib Dems hold sway, are any different. The research, undertaken by Philip Cowley, Professor of Parliamentary Government at Nottingham University, suggests football remains the working man’s game, so long as Labour is the working man’s party. Both Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Arsenal are all located in solid Labour seats. Kate Green, MP for Stretford and Urmston holding Old Trafford, has nearly a 9,000 majority, while Lucy Powell, MP for Manchester Central, the constituency housing the Etihad Stadium, has around a 10,000 majority. Liverpool Walton, encompassing Anfield, is represented by Steve Rotherham, who gained 20,000 more votes than anyone else at the 2010 general election. Steve Rotheram MP (left), of Liverpool Walton, the constituency that contains Liverpool and Raheem Sterling .

Kate Green (left), MP for Stretford and Urmston, which holds Manchester United's Old Trafford ground, where Wayne Rooney is captain of the Premier League's biggest and most successful football club . Five years ago Jeremy Corbyn won Islington North, where the Emirates Stadium is located, with a majority of 12,400. Chelsea and Fulham, holding both Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, voted in Tory Greg Hands with a 16,700 majority. Birmingham Ladywood is the only other constituency home to two clubs, both Birmingham City and Aston Villa. The residents voted Labour by a 10,000 majority in 2010. Alexis Sanchez (left) is the brightest star at Arsenal. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is the MP for Islington North . Lucy Powell (left), Labour MP for Manchester Central, can boast that Manchester City is in her constituency . Labour dominate urban areas, so their supremacy on football terms is to be expected. The Tories, with their traditional rural support, are not the natural choice of many living near grounds. Villa fan Cameron’s Whitney seat does not include Oxford United’s Kassam Stadium, for example. That is Labour. Nick Clegg’s Sheffield Hallam does not incorporate Wednesday or United either. They are Labour. Miliband is MP for Doncaster North, but the Keepmoat Stadium falls in Doncaster Central, a Labour stronghold nevertheless.","Premier League clubs are overwhelmingly in Labour constituencies .

9309,e1f0055686932591d7189f53907a148fa7b8dec8,"Former England captain Kevin Sinfield has been warned he will be a 'target' when he makes the switch to rugby union at the end of the season. Sinfield, 34, the greatest captain in Leeds' history, stunned the world of rugby league on Tuesday with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie on an 18-month contract. Leeds Rhinos captain Kevin Sinfield is to switch codes and join Yorkshire Carnegie at the end of the season . Castleford head coach Daryl Powell, the man who made Sinfield captain at the age of 22, trod the same path, although in a coaching capacity after losing the Rhinos top job in 2003, and has a word of warning for his former team-mate. 'It surprised me a little bit,' Powell said. 'It will be interesting to see if he can make a success of it but he's been an outstanding player and captain within the sport and you wouldn't back against him. I think he's been unbelievable in his career. 'He won't need my advice. He knows what he's doing. I'm sure he will have done all his homework. Sinfield (centre) lifts the Super League trophy after Leeds beat Warrington in the grand final in October 2012 . 'It's certainly a challenge. You look at Sam Burgess and what he's going through, and Iestyn Harris - it's tough. It's not an easy thing to do. 'The one thing you do have is a bit of a sign on you, on your head. You're a bit of a target. 'It's a completely different sport. It will be interesting to see what position he's going to play, but I wish him all the best.' Sinfield is tackled during a match between Leeds Rhinos and Leigh Centurions last year . Sinfield, who has guided the Rhinos to six Super League titles, three World Club Challenges and the Challenge Cup in 2014 at the expense of Powell's Castleford, will be the second high-profile departure from Headingley at the end of the year following Jamie Peacock's appointment as Hull KR's new football manager. The former Golden Boot winner is closing in on third place in rugby league's all-time scoring list with 3,997 points, but Powell believes his old club have a ready-made replacement in 20-year-old Liam Sutcliffe, who has deputised for an injured Sinfield in the last two matches. 'They've got some really good young players,' Powell said. 'Liam Sutcllife has slotted in there and seems to be doing a good job. He looks like a mature young player who can handle things pretty much the way Kevin did when he was a young fella. Sinfield (left) in action for England against France during the 2013 Rugby League World Cup quarter-final . 'I was obviously at the back end of my career when Kevin started and it looked like he was going to be an outstanding player. But I don't think anyone could have foreseen how good he was going to be and how many things he would win and how much he would grow as a leader in the game. He's been awesome.' Sinfield has been named in Leeds' 19-man squad for Friday's derby at Castleford, but coach Brian McDermott will not rush his skipper back. 'I'm not sure if he's going to be fit for Friday,' McDermott said. 'What we have got to make sure when Kev does come back into the team is that he's 100 per cent fit. 'Sutcliffe's played really well in these last couple of games. He's held his own and in some parts of the games has played really well. 'It's good to know that while Kevin's in recovery, Sutty is doing a good job and getting more experience.'","Kevin Sinfield has announced he is leaving Leeds at the end of the season .

3773,fbecccaa47261466dd566833258c12b4f899bc41,"Known locally as Millionaires’ Row, the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac of 11 white Art Deco houses with private beaches at the end of Hove promenade is a real-life version of the TV comedy Stella Street. The sitcom featured impressionists playing celebrities such as Michael Caine and Keith Richards living as neighbours. But put the rubbish out here in Hove and you could be saying good morning to Oscar and Grammy award-winning singer Adele, Little Britain comedian and novelist David Walliams, DJ Norman Cook and his Strictly Come Dancing wife Zoe Ball, and former EastEnders and Heartbeat star Nick Berry. Scroll down for video . One of the white Art Deco houses on the Western Esplanade cul-de-sac has gone on sale for £4million . In previous years you might have been greeted by Paul McCartney, his then wife Heather Mills, or even by partying guests such as Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner. The homes were built between 1909 and 1910 by developer Michael Paget Baxter when overcrowding on British beaches in their heyday meant that a home with a private beach was the last word in luxury. And that still seems to be true. With celebrities occupying six of the properties – Cook and his wife have three, two for them and one for relatives – that leaves just five other houses. And in a rare event, one of those has just come on the market, for a guide price of £4 million. Approached from the back, the cul-de-sac does not look anything special, tucked away behind the warehouses of the working port of Shoreham. But sitting in the lounge of Malcolm VandenBurg’s splendid home on a sunny day, with the sea seemingly lapping at the floor-to-ceiling windows, you could be in Miami or Malibu. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors. Decking stretches on to the beach, and there is a hot tub. Stunning: The view of the sea from the property's modern living room. The whole of the back of the house is glass on the ground and first floors . Meet the locals: Singer Adele has a house in the exclusive cul-de-sac alongside comedian David Walliams . ‘Bringing the sea into the house was the aim,’ says Malcolm, a retired Harley Street doctor. ‘Bizarrely, the former owners didn’t make use of the sea views. So I opened up the back and put the terrace in and the balcony upstairs. ‘Now, when you walk in the front door you can see the sea from everywhere. It took a year but it was well worth it. It still takes my breath away every time I come home. ‘And sitting outside on the terrace with a fish barbecue with the sound system on full is just perfect. I’ve had a lot of impromptu parties.’ Malcolm, in his 60s and the father of four grown-up children, bought the four-bedroom house in 2010 after moving from London, where he had seen Adele perform at the Roundhouse in what he describes as his favourite gig of all time. So when the singer moved in to the cul-de-sac, he was ‘starstruck’. ‘She has this lovely little dog and, in the summer, when all the doors are open, the dog wanders into my house and Adele comes round to find it. She’s completely normal and everyone here is very pleasant and we all get on well,’ says Malcolm. Price £4 million . Location Hove, East Sussex . Bedrooms 4 . Unique features Beach for a back garden; cinema room; huge dressing room; high-tech controls for hi-fi, curtains, lighting; celebrities on every side . He also welcomed Walliams and his wife, model Lara Stone, by taking round a bunch of flowers. Unhappily they have now split up. Cook popped round one day when he heard that Malcolm was selling his vinyl record collection. ‘I thought he might buy the lot, but he didn’t want any of them,’ he laughs. The ground floor of Malcolm’s house has oak flooring throughout and there is a large entrance hall with a floating staircase, a media/cinema room, kitchen, snug and a 45ft lounge. Upstairs, the master suite and bathroom overlook the sea and a huge dressing room is the size of some of the designer clothes shops in the nearby North Laine of Brighton. Malcolm’s home has the latest high-tech automated systems, including a Lutron lighting control system, video door entry, digital music and video systems, integrated speakers, motorised curtains – in fact, everything a celebrity would be looking for. So who does he think will buy the house? Has Cook already been round with an offer to add to his portfolio? ‘No he hasn’t,’ says Malcolm. ‘I think he’s happy with what he has at the moment. But whoever does buy will never get tired of the wonderful, ever-changing views. Like me, they’ll fall in love with it straight away.’ Selling agent Jason Brand says: ‘This is the best beach residence to come on the market for years and one of the very few homes in Brighton, indeed the UK, to have direct private beach access.’","Hove promenade's white Art Deco houses are filled with British celebrities .

Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the ‘most creative’ player in the world. ‘The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,’ said Cantona, ‘Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.’ Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders £29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi’s 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo’s 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona’s assessment. ‘Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.’ Cantona was third in the Ballon d’Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been overlooked by Cantona despite netting 45 times this season . ‘Catalonia won the World Cup,’ said Cantona, speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai. ‘Spain won it with 10 Barcelona players in the team. Spain did not win the World Cup, Catalonia did. Barcelona won it. ‘My grandparents are from Catalunya, from Barcelona. They arrived in France in '39. There was a civil war.

Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of an export permit will bolster their claim that the 1824 oil painting – Beaching A Boat, Brighton – was legitimately brought to Britain. The 1946 document bears the signature of a dealer called Karola Fabri and seeks permission for the transfer of artworks from Budapest to Zurich, including one by Constable identified as Fishing Boat. Scroll down for video . New evidence? Tate Britain chiefs believe the chance discovery of a 1946 export permit (pictured) will bolster their claim that Constable's painting was legitimately brought to Britain . Constable's masterpiece Beaching A Boat, Brighton was looted by the Nazis from its Jewish owner during the Second World War . The discovery of the permit in the archives of Budapest’s Museum of Fine Arts is the latest twist in an increasingly fraught dispute between the Tate and the descendants of the painting’s original owner, Baron Ferenc Hatvany, who died in 1958. The descendants of Hatvany – believed to be two daughters and a grandchild – say the Nazis stole the painting and smuggled it out of Hungary. It turned up in Britain in 1962 and passed through several hands before being donated to the Tate in 1986. The family launched a claim three years ago. The Government-backed Spoliation Advisory Panel, which rules on disputes over looted art, supported the heirs last year and said the Tate had a ‘moral obligation’ to return the painting. Sources close to the case say the export permit could prove the Tate’s claim that Hatvany voluntarily disposed of the painting while he was still alive. The Tate does not dispute that the painting was looted by the Nazis but the gallery’s understanding is that it was returned to the owner after the war and then legitimately exported. Stormy seas: The battle over Constable's painting evokes the story of a Jewish refugee's fight to reclaim a looted picture in the film Woman in Gold (pictured) Gallery chiefs are expected to argue that the permit proves the work was still in Hungary after the war. But The Mail on Sunday understands the claimants will argue the permit doesn’t change anything as it does not identify Hatvany. One source said: ‘If you had stolen the painting, you would still need to get an export permit to get it out of the country.’ A source at the Tate explained that there was legal duty to protect any assets owned by the British public, which is why the gallery argued that the painting should remain in the UK. They said: ‘No one disputes that the picture was at one stage looted by the Nazis, what is in dispute is what happened after it was returned to its owner.’ The dispute evokes the story of Dame Helen Mirren’s new film, Woman In Gold, which charts the story of how Jewish refugee Maria Altmann battled for almost a decade with the Austrian government to reclaim Gustav Klimt’s iconic picture of her aunt called Portrait Of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.","'Beaching A Boat, Brighton' taken from Jewish owner in Second World War .

Obama loosened the trade embargo early this year with a series of executive actions that allow easier U.S. travel to Cuba, more remittances to the island and, at least on paper, U.S. exports to support the island's relatively new private business sector. Obama also moved to remove Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terror, removing a barrier to access to the global financial system. Cuban officials have been pushing Obama to go further with measures that could include more specific federal licenses for U.S. businesses to trade with Cuba in ways currently prohibited. 'The president of the United States has the ability to grant licenses to businesses so that businesses can actually start developing right now in select areas and those are areas that we want to pursue,' Cuomo said.

According to the menu, this is the best combo for that particular strain as the 'pot/sandwich pairing has been known to induce intense relaxation.' The falafel topping counter at the restaurant includes julienne vegetables, salads and various dips .

But for anyone with a few hundred thousand to spare, it could be a dream  come true.

An idyllic two-bedroom log cabin, nestled down a private country lane in the heart of the New Forest, has gone on the market for £350,000 . The 76-sq ft hideaway, based near the tiny Hampshire hamlet of Newgrounds, near Godshill, is made entirely from timber imported from Norway . Its ideal location means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthouse would be worth elsewhere. It has 141,000 acres of forest surrounding the cabin . But its ideal location  means the cabin is worth more than twice what a similar bolthole would be worth elsewhere. For the same amount, buyers could own a three-bedroom Grade II-listed former school house just a few miles down the road in Ringwood. A four-bedroom detached bungalow with a huge garden in the New Forest town of Holbury is also for sale for £350,000. The aptly-named Log Cabin could be a suitable home for a small family or couple, with two bedrooms, a sizeable living room and a balcony which looks onto a south-facing garden. Despite looking like an ideal holiday retreat, the cabin also comes with permission to live in it all year round. But the real selling point is the 141,000 acres of forest that surround the cabin. The aptly-named Log Cabin could do for a small family, with two bedrooms, a sizeable living room (pictured), and a balcony which looks onto a south-facing garden . Despite looking like an ideal holiday retreat, the cabin also comes with permission to live in it all year round . The property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished. They are now selling the log cabin as they no longer need it. Kesia Whitfield, from estate agents Symonds and Sampson, said: 'The Log Cabin is down an unmade track. It's a no through road so it's very quiet and the owner would have direct access to picturesque forest walks from there. 'What's special about this one is you can live in it 365 days a year. They've got planning permission to live there all year round, not just for holiday lets.' She added: 'We think it will appeal to people looking for a New Forest bolthole or as an investment holiday let but also somebody who wants to live in the New Forest that hasn't got a huge budget. The property was built in 2004 by the owners of the next door home who needed a place to stay while their house was refurbished . Some 80 per cent of the enquiries have reportedly been from people who want to live in the cabin full-time . The property is situated in the New Forest, the former hunting ground of William the Conquerer. Pictured: The bathroom in the property . 'This is a great way to have your own little bit of the forest. You have got access to miles and miles of forest walks and spectacular far-reaching views over the forest heathland.' She said 80 per cent of the enquiries were from people who wanted to live there full time. She said: 'You might get similar holiday homes in holiday parks for half the price, but there you're on a camping site and you can only stay a certain amount of days.' According to property website Rightmove, the average price of a house in the New Forest is just shy of £370,000. The New Forest was created as a royal hunting enclave in 1079 when King William I, also known as William the Conquerer, wanted somewhere to hunt. Ten centuries on, the Forest is still largely in royal hands, with around 90 per cent of it belonging to the Crown. It became a National Park in 2005. The park, measuring 571 square kilometres, is set in a rough triangular shape across a large portion of Hampshire. It is bounded by Christchurch in the south west, Southampton in the east, and Fordingbridge and Redlynch in the north. A foal walking in the New Forest. The National Park in Hampshire is home to around 3,000 ponies . The forest is also famed for the New Forest pony, one of the recognised native breeds of the British Isles. There are estimated to be around 3,000 roaming the area. The countryside also boasts countless cycling and walking paths, as well as several decent museums and a host of famous country pubs. Bizarrely, the New Forest is also linked with one of Britain's most enduring mysteries. William Rufus, the Conqueror's son and successor, was shot and killed by a stray arrow while hunting in the Forest in 1100. Whether he was assassinated or  the victim of an accident remains a matter of debate. The Rufus Stone, a small memorial near Stoney Cross in the heart of the Forest, marks the spot where he reputedly fell.

Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his arms weakly raised in the air.In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, . Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. He later described his release as 'wonderful' and during a press conference he said he'd always dreamed of going home. His attorney said he will stay under a 7pm to 7am curfew with a couple in East Hartford. Last month a court ruled Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, was deprived of a fair trial for the 1987 killing and on Friday, a judge ordered him to be freed on $25,000 cash bail . One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner. He also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference. Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole. Lapointe's lawyer and supporters said the evidence showed he could not have committed the crimes and his mental disability made him vulnerable to giving a false confession. His case became a cause celebre, receiving widespread publicity as advocates for the mentally disabled and other supporters - including writers Arthur Miller and William Styron - rallied to prove his innocence. Finally, last month the state Supreme Court ruled that Lapointe was deprived of a fair trial because prosecutors failed to disclose notes by a police officer that may have supported an alibi defense. The former inmate was photographed walking out of the hearing alongside his attorney and another supporter with his weakly arms raised in the air . In lieu of his prison jumpsuit, Lapointe opted for a dark T-shirt over a dress shirt emblazoned with the words 'I didn't do it'. The decision upheld an earlier ruling by the state Appellate Court, which in 2012 overturned Lapointe's convictions for capital felony murder, sexual assault and other crimes. The court ruled that Lapointe be released or given a new trial. Murder charges have been refiled but the prosecutor, Gail Hardy, said the state needs to review the evidence before deciding whether it can go forward with another trial. Lapointe is due back in court on May 15. On Friday Lapointe, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, shackles and thick glasses, was hunched over and visibly shaking as he sipped from a cup of water in court. His supporters and attorneys say Lapointe could not have committed the crime due to his disabilities. One of his first requests Friday was for a steak dinner - he also expressed fascination with the smartphones reporters were using during the news conference . Lapointe confessed to raping, strangling and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 and was sentenced in 1992 to life in prison without parole (undated inmate photo above) He suffers from Dandy-Walker syndrome, which affects brain development and causes intellectual and physical impairments. They say Lapointe, who confessed after nearly ten hours of police interrogation, was railroaded under pressure and that he barely understood what was happening to him. Lapointe's release was processed by court officials, and he was freed from custody in the afternoon. The judge rejected a request by prosecutors that Lapointe wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. Defense attorneys say their client cannot drive and is barely able to walk, therefore he does not pose a flight risk. 'We are ecstatic that after all these years Richard is finally being freed. 'This was a travesty of justice from the start,' said Kate Germond, director of Centurion Ministries, a nonprofit organization that works to vindicate people who have been wrongfully convicted. 'He will finally get to sleep in a real bed and breathe some fresh air today for the first time since his unjust incarceration,' she said.","Richard Lapointe, a former dishwasher, confessed to raping and stabbing 88-year-old Bernice Martin at her Manchester apartment in 1989 .

The 35-year-old served a one-game ban after he admitted breaking the SFA's zero-tolerance gambling rules by betting on a total of 50 games in a year. But SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan challenged that decision, claiming his punishment was 'unduly lenient'. The Scottish FA have failed in their attempt to further punish Rangers' goalkeeper Steve Simonsen for betting . However, Simonsen's legal team from the ProLegal group have confirmed the Englishman will not face a further suspension after the SFA's appeal was rejected by an appellate tribunal. They tweeted: 'SFA Appeal against Steve Simonsen suspension fails.' Simonsen had not bet on any games relating to his club's competitions and was given a one-match ban with another suspended when an SFA-convened judicial panel convened on February 12. He missed the club's February 13 clash with Hibernian but has not played since after dropping down Gers' goalkeeping pecking order. Previous judicial panels have issued more severe punishments for betting offences, but they have involved players betting on games in which they were involved. In September 2013, Simonsen's Ibrox team-mate Ian Black was handed a 10-game ban - seven of which were suspended - and a £7,500 fine after admitted to placing 160 football bets over a seven-year period. Three of the matches involved bets placed against the former Hearts and Inverness midfielder's own team, which included a gamble that Rangers would draw against East Stirlingshire. Black scored the third goal in his side's 4-2 win, a result that scuppered his own accumulator. Five months later, Ayr United frontman Michael Moffat was given a four-game ban - with another two suspended - after he was found guilty of placing seven bets on six matches involving his own team. Moffat, who avoided a fine, was also found guilty of placing an additional 150 bets on other games.

Humiliated: Craig Roberts, 36, was told by Post Office staff in Chadderton, Manchester, that he would have to leave his guide dog Bruce outside if he wanted to be served. He said he was left feeling 'angry and shocked' Mr Roberts said: 'I was left feeling so angry and shocked. It is unacceptable that I should be made to feel like I had done something wrong by going to the Post Office with my guide dog. In this day and age there should be more awareness than that.' He added: 'Luckily a couple of customers heard him and said he wasn't allowed to do it because I had a guide dog and that he would have to let me in. He was told a few times and wasn't happy about it.' Mr Roberts, who had gone to the Post Office to top up his electric meter with his payment card, was eventually served by the employee after a ten minute standoff. He said: 'He did serve me in the end. I think he only served me because the other customers interjected. You could tell they were angry and a couple shouted ""you can't do that, he has a guide dog"".'

Mr Roberts was born with glaucoma, a condition which affects eyesight as a result of pressure built up behind the eye, but in the last 12 months has seen a radical decline in his sight. He now has only 30 per cent vision in one eye which means he can't work and struggles with everyday tasks such as cooking and cleaning. The 36-year-old, who lives alone, said: 'I find it difficult doing everyday tasks at home as it is. Making a meal is tricky as I have to make sure it is cooked and cleaning is quite hard because I can't see dust and dirt. Under the Equality Act 2010, people with disabilities have the same right to services supplied by shops, banks, hotels, libraries, pubs, taxis and restaurants as everyone else. Service providers also have to make 'reasonable adjustments' for guide dog and assistance dog owners which might mean offering extra help, and this includes allowing guide dogs and assistance dogs into all public places with their owners. 'It takes quite a lot to go out to the shops as it is and so to be made to feel that I can't even go to the Post Office to simply pay a bill is ridiculous.' Mr Roberts said he has 'never experienced anything like this before' but that he has been told a similar incident with a fellow guide dog user at this particular Post Office has happened. He added: 'This incident has really knocked my confidence and made me think if I can't take Bruce to the Post Office, will this happened again at the shops or a café? It was really embarrassing and humiliating.' So angered was Mr Roberts by the incident that he went straight to a nearby library and lodged an official complaint with the Post Office. He also contacted Manchester Guide Dogs Association, which has been in contact with the Post Office. Sorry: The Post Office has issued an apology 'for any distress caused' following the incident . A spokesman for Guide Dogs said: 'We're always saddened when we hear about a shop or another service provider refusing access to a guide dog owner. The Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to deny access to a guide dog owner. We are always happy to work with the Post Office, or any other organisation to help them understand their duties under the Equalities Act.' Mr Roberts said: 'I want a written apology from the Post Office and assurance this will never happen to me or any other guide dog user again. 'It is totally unacceptable and they should have greater awareness.' Having posted the incident on Facebook he said he had received numerous comments in support of his complaint. 'One gentleman said that if that is the way the Post Office deals with a disabled person he would never come into the Post Office again,' said Mr Roberts, who has had Bruce for seven months and says he's his best friend. He has called the Chadderton Post Office employee's response to his guide dog 'outdated'. 'It is clearly an outdated view of things. I think something needs to be done to educate people that if you have a guide dog it should not stop you from getting about and shouldn't stop you from doing the things that everyone else gets to do,' Mr Roberts said. 'I was determined to get this into the public eye because it probably does happen too often and happening just once is too many times.' A spokesman for the Post Office said: 'Post Office policy is to allow guide dogs and other assistance dogs into branches and we would like to apologise for any distress caused.' Chadderton postmaster Mr Parekh said: 'I have spoken to Craig and arranged for him to come back into the shop.

Reardon claims he was subjected to violence 'without provocation' and suffered acute respiratory failure and had to be put on a ventilator in hospital. He was in ICU for 4 days. He says he also suffered multiple broken bones, including ribs, nose and sternum. Reardon told TMZ that after he got out of his Chevy Suburban near 5th and Main Streets in Chico, he was tackled to the floor and 'hog tied'. He said he was then thrown into the back of a van by police before being taken to hospital after the incident on February 18, at about 9.40pm. Officers claim Reardon had failed to appear at court on gun charges and refused to raise his hands after being stopped. They said he then attempted to flee when pulled over. In the footage an officer is shown repeatedly hitting Reardon with an object as he lay on the ground . Butte County Chief deputy District Attorney claimed the officers used force to restrain Reardon. He was said to be almost twice over the legal limit for driving and had traces of methamphetamine and cocaine in his blood. Reardon had allegedly hit two cars while trying to get away from the officers, KRCRtv reported. After he hit a parked car he is said to have got out of the vehicle and approached an officer, before complying with orders to lie on the ground. Reardon has denied charges of evading a peace officer, DUI, DUI with alcohol or drugs within 10 years of a prior, and resisting an executive officer . He has not been granted bail. Reardon is on the floor as one of the officers crouches down beside him and the other gets ready to hit him . The 30-year-old claims he was left with broken bones and ribs after being subjected to the brutal beating . The video footage has emerged as tensions over police brutality have increased in America following a number of shootings and incidences of violence caught on camera in recent weeks. This week helicopter cameras captured police beating Francis Pusok at least 80 times after they had already tasered him. Police had tried to arrest him at his southern California and he fled on a horse - sparking a two hour chase before he fell off and was beaten. Last week footage emerged of unarmed black man Derek Harris, 44, being shot dead by a 74-year-old reserve deputy in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He claimed he had accidentally mistaken his hand gun for his taser and had not intended to kill Mr Harris, who was being chased by police following a sting operation. Walter Scott was shot in the back as he attempted to flee police, after being pulled over for a broken tail light . Officers were seen surrounding Francis Pusok as he lay on the ground after falling off his horse . Police officer Michael Slager was charged with murder earlier this month after video captured on a mobile phone showed him shooting Walter Scott, a coast guard veteran, in the back as he ran away. Mr Scott had been pulled over for driving with a broken tail light . Evidence of police brutality has caused outrage in America and led to high profile protests. Hundreds of protesters wore 'I can't breathe' t-shirts at a basketball match in Brooklyn in tribute to black father-of-six Eric Garner who died after being held in a fatal chokehold. Last year days of protests were held after the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. The 18-year-old was stopped and shot dead by by white officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis, Missouri, suburb on August 9.","Sean Reardon was stopped by police on suspected drunk driving charges .

The Gulf state's Constellation Hotels bought the 64 per cent stake in hotel company Coroin - which owns five-star offerings Claridge's, The Berkeley and The Connaught - from billionaire brothers Sir David and Sir Frederick Barclay. It is not known how much the deal is worth, but some have reported it could be as much as £1.6billion. The hotels are the latest in an impressive list of high-profile acquisitions for the country, whose investment arm has been snapping up a number of the city's landmark buildings including The Shard, Harrods and One Canada Tower - the centrepiece of the Canary Wharf financial district. Constellation also recently bought London Park Lane Hotel, and owns Le Grand hotel in Paris.

Helen Dunn, 78, wasn't ever expecting to relive her daring past, but was surprised when she opened a copy of the Sunday Mercury newspaper to find a photo of herself starring back. The mother-of-two and grandmother, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, was flicking through the newspaper when she spotted herself on the cover of a raunchy lads' mag from 1955. Helen Dunn, 78, was shocked to discover her cover images for vintage lads mag Span, when she opened the Sunday Mercury newspaper . Vintage beauty: The grandma, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, was only 17 years old at the time of the cover shoot . The cover was featured as a part of collector Tim Beddow's 'antiques rudeshow' collection of 700 vintage men's mags, the Birmingham Mail reports. And there Dunn was - under her model pseudonym, Sherry Morris - on the cover of top-shelf British magazine, Span. The cover image shows Dunn, who was just 17 years old at the time, perched seductively on a stool with her legs slightly crossed. Naughty or nice: Helen made all her own costumes for the raunchy shoot for Span, including the fur muff (pictured right) 'I was always outgoing' - Helen didn't mind the risqué nature of the shoot, in which she posed seductively for the camera . The 78-year-old wears an off-the-shoulder top, and her stockings and suspenders are in full display. In an interview with the Birmingham Mail, the glamorous gran admitted that she was shocked to see the images. She said: 'When I saw the picture I was absolutely shocked. 'I shouted, 'That's me! I think it's great, I have no secrets.' Back in the day, Dunn had a brief stint as a model, before she went on to marry a professional footballer three years later: Manchester United's Alan Dunn. Dunn (pictured right) went on to marry Manchester United footballer Alan Dunn (left), just three years after the cover shoot . The grandmother recalls her modelling days with a fondness, and remembers the shoot clearly. Helen had even made her own outfit, including the fur muff. She had posed in the garden of local photographer Royston Campbell after a friend of Helen sent him images. 'He was a gentleman, a very nice man,' she recalls. 'Nothing iffy about him at all. 'I always made my own outfits, even the umbrellas. The picture was originally for a Christmas calendar. 'Back in the day, I wasn't bad looking and didn't have a bad figure' - Helen looks back on her modelling days . 'I suppose the magazine was looked on as a little risqué, but it really didn't bother me. I didn't think about it. I was always outgoing. When breaking the news to her two grown-up children, Helen had no worries about how her former career would be perceived. She admitted: 'You know what? They think it's great.' 'Back in the day, I wasn't bad looking and didn't have a bad figure.'","Helen Dunn opened Sunday Mercury newspaper, saw raunchy pics .

1692,bf6b81a1a1a4f9ce493dc5f5216e68c6399e6c8e,"Lord Janner, pictured, is alleged to have sexually assaulted young men in the 1970s and 1980s in children's homes in Leicestershire. His alleged victims could bring civil claims against him . Lord Greville Janner - the Labour peer accused of molesting young boys in the 1970s and 1980s - could be tested by experts to prove he has dementia as part of civil claims brought by his alleged victims, a lawyer has said. The family of the 86-year-old politician has been told he will not face child abuse charges because of his memory problems, but he could still face civil action from complainants. Legal firm Slater & Gordon are representing several people looking to take private action against Lord Janner, with police having identified 25 people who say the Labour peer attacked them. Each could claim up to £100,000. Lord Janner has been accused of preying on young boys at three Leicester care homes between 1969 and 1989, with prosecutors arguing there is 'overwhelming' cause to charge the former MP with 22 sex attacks on nine victims - the youngest aged just 10 at the time. Richard Scorer, head of the abuse team at Slater & Gordon, told Jamie Doward at The Observer newspaper that they were investigating the prospect of having Lord Janner examined by third-party expert witnesses. 'I have certainly dealt with civil claims before where the alleged abuser has claimed to have dementia and we have been able to have them medically examined in relation to that,' he said. 'It is something we could consider doing. It would depend on the detailed evidence that is available about his medical condition but, potentially, there is provision in the civil law for us to do that.' The director of public prosecutions Alison Saunder when she decided not to pursue the charges of historic sex abuse. She said there was 'no public interest' in prosecuting Lord Janner because of his dementia, adding that his illness made him unfit to plead - amid accusations of a 45-year cover-up over his alleged actions. Scroll down for video . Prosecutors say there is substantial cause to charge Lord Janner with 22 charges of sexual assault on nine victims, but the director for public prosecutions sad the extent of his dementia made him unfit to face trial . Lord Janner with the Queen in 2003. In the same month his Westminster office was raiding by police the deeds to his £2million house were transferred to his children. Lawyers are questioning the extent of his dementia . Ms Saunder admitted that Lord Janner should have been prosecuted on three separate occasions - in 1991, 2002 and 2007, but botched investigations each time meant he escaped a prosecution. The CPS has been accused of double standards, after a MailOnline investigation revealed that at least 19 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including 10 in the last year. Lord Janner voted in the House of Lord 210 times between his Alzheimer's diagnosis and the end of 2013, leading some to suggest he could have been prosecuted if authorities had acted sooner. His alleged victims will be seeking compensation if evidence of wrongdoing is uncovered. The family of Lord Janner say he is innocent. However, this has been made more difficult since Lord Janner transferred ownership of his Hampstead Heath flat, estimated to be worth around £2million, in March 2014. The transfer took place in the same month that police raided the politician's office in Westminster . Director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders has come under fire for refusing to prosecute Lord Janner after saying his dementia would make him unfit to plead - admitting he should have been prosecuted before . Slater & Gordon represents 168 of Jimmy Savile's victims and 10 of former Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith. Mr Scorer said he believes it is 'outrageous' that allegations of sex abuse are only being investigated now, adding that the transfer of Lord Janner's assets would not put off the clients from pursuing legal actions. 'The question I would ask is: if he actually has dementia, on what basis does he have the capacity to transfer ownership of assets?' he said. There appears to be a contradiction between saying on the one hand that 'he has dementia' and on the other that he has been able to effect a transfer of assets. 'If there's evidence that the transaction has been done to avoid potential creditors that is something we could challenge.'","No criminal charges against 86-year-old but alleged victims could sue .

A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged and television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood. The attack comes a day after Turkish prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz, 46, died in hospital after members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. It is not known who fired the fatal shots. Scroll down for video . Shot dead: A picture of the red-haired woman lying on the ground with a rifle strapped to her body and a handgun by her side has emerged . Police HQ: Television footage showed police sealing off the street in the central Aksaray neighbourhood . Armed: The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained . 'The Istanbul police headquarters on Vatan street was targeted by rifle fire and a female terrorist was killed in the clash,' the Istanbul governor's office said in a statement today. The woman was carrying a rifle, two hand grenades and one pistol, it said. Local media said a man had also been detained. Separately, police detained a gunman on Wednesday who entered an Istanbul branch of the ruling AK Party and hung from its window a Turkish flag with the emblem of a sword added. It was not immediately clear whether any of the attacks were linked, but Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned of the risk of 'provocations' and attempts to cause chaos ahead of June's national election. Today, the grieving family of Mr Kiraz who died after being shot in the head and chest during yesterday's courthouse siege wept over his coffin at his funeral. His coffin was covered with the Turkish flag for his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul.

Threat: The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front published disturbing photographs of the terrified prosecutor with a gun to his head on their official Facebook page before he was shot . Two of his captors were killed after security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Turkish authorities on Wednesday detained 22 suspected members of the group in the southern city of Antalya after receiving a tip-off they were planning further attacks, the Dogan news agency reported. Meanwhile hundreds of lawyers, prosecutors and staff stood in respect on every floor of the giant Istanbul Caglayan Palace of Justice where Kiraz worked and the hostage drama unfolded. 'We will not forget you, our martyr,' read a gigantic banner, as a huge Turkish flag was hung from the top floor. The courthouse is to be renamed after Kiraz. Justice Minister Kenan Ipek said the two members of the DHKP-C who took him hostage had 'held a gun to the nation'. 'We don't see this as an attack on our deceased prosecutor, but on the whole justice system,' he said at a ceremony for Mr Kiraz. 'Our state is powerful enough to track down those behind these lowlifes... The fact these assassins are dead shouldn't put those nefarious and dark forces at ease.' Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Mourning: The coffin of the prosecutor was passed through the crowds of mourners gathered to pay their respects. He had been leading an investigation into the death of teenager Berkin Elvan, who died aged 15 . Respects: Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu (L), the son of killed prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz (C) and Turkish National Assembly President Cemil Cicek (R) stand by Kiraz' coffin in Istanbul . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Defiant: Mourners at the funeral of Kiraz hold a picture of the prosecutor high in tribute to the lawyer . Mr Kiraz, a father of two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Police chief Selami Altınok said officers stormed the building on Tuesday after hearing gunshots, and killed two of the gunmen. 'We carried out the negotiation for six hours. But our security forces launched the operation after gunshots were heard while terrorists were speaking on the phone during the negotiation,' he said. Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Shattered: The broken window of the room where prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was held hostage and shot . The emergency began at 2.36pm local time (12.36 GMT) when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed into the office of Mr Kiraz. Images of a masked militant holding a gun to Mr Kiraz's head were then posted on the group's Facebook page, along with a demand for police to confess on live TV within the hour. Armed police rushed to the scene and were shown escorting court officials out of the building, but there was no sign of Mr Kiraz before the deadline arrived and live TV feeds were cut. Shots were then heard from inside the building, according to the Dogan news agency. In a statement published by Turkish media, the hostage taking was claimed by the Marxist Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, which has been behind a string of recent attacks. The group published pictures showing one of the militants - his face concealed by a scarf with the group's red and yellow insignia - holding a gun to Kiraz's head.

Over: Istanbul Security Chief Selami Altinok, centre-right, and Deputy Chief Prosecutor Orhan Kapici speak to the media outside the main courthouse in Istanbul at the end of the siege . They had also plastered their flags and posters on the walls of his office. Turkish media said that the group had given a deadline of 3:36 pm (13.36 BST) for the prosecutor to identify the police officers who they say were behind the killing of Elvan or he would be shot. In a brief video message on a widely-followed Twitter account describing itself as that of Elvan's family, his father appeared to call on the group not to harm the prosecutor. 'We want justice. We don't want anyone to shed even a drop of blood. We don't want other mothers to cry,' Sami Elvan said. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu met with the current and former interior and justice ministers at the ruling AK Party headquarters in Ankara to discuss the hostage taking, officials in his office said. Gunshots: According to the Dogan news agency, gunshots were heard from inside the building after the militant group's deadline passed . Demands: The group were demanding that Mr Kiraz name the policemen implicated in Mr Elvan's death, which has become a rallying point for the country's far-left . The DHKP-C said on its website it wanted the police officer it blames for Elvan's death to 'confess' on television, the officers involved to be tried in 'people's courts', and charges against those who attended protests for Elvan to be dropped. The DHKP-C blames the ruling AK Party for the killing of teenager Elvan. He was aged 15 at the time of his death, which was followed by mass nationwide protests that were also largely put down by the police. Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death. The United States, European Union and Turkey list the DHKP-C as a terrorist organisation. It was behind a suicide bombing at the U.S. Embassy in 2013. In 2001, two policemen and an Australian tourist died in a DHKP-C attack in central Istanbul. Innocent: Berkin was on his way to buy bread during anti-government street protests when he was struck in the head by a high-velocity gas canister .

But the site lists the retail value of the items as $23.85 - and that's without the added burden of entrance fees, rides and long queues at the show. Other bags offer some rather trivial savings. At the lower end of the price scale, buyers of the Fruit Tingles bag will get three 34 gram packets of the disc-shaped lollies, one 34 gram packet of fruit pastilles, two Redskins, two lollipops and two Milko sticks for $5. That's a saving of $0.10 on the listed total retail value is $5.10. The Aussie Bogan bag - if that's your thing - offers better value. For $15 buyers will get a drinking cap with Aussie flag, a mullet wig, fake bogan teeth, Aussie pride stubby holder, and an infatable Aussie flag bat and bar poster, altogether worth $50.90. Capping it off is a 'discount amusement ride voucher' with a listed value of $0.00. One bag on the site seems to offer unbelievable value, literally. The Rockstar bag includes an inflatable guitar, toy trilby and some items including a tinsel hair clip the site lists as worth $395, giving the bag a total retail value of $413.70 for the bargain price of $10. A quick online scan reveals the hair clip price is almost certainly a typo. The official website displays the retail value of the showbags contents, reveal that some of the bags cost more than it would to buy the items outright-such as the Cowboy Bag (L)-while others are a mere 10 cents less than their retail value-like the Fruit Tingles Bag . Some of the bags have grossly inaccurate value listings-such as the Rockstar Bag (L)-while the Aussie Bogan bag alludes to the shows biggest attraction having zero value . Sydney's Royal East Show is one of the biggest events on the school holiday calendar, and is the largest of the annual carnivals that tour the country each year. Growing out of the agricultural show circuit, Australia's annual shows have become major attractions in cities and country town that include farm animal and fruit and vegetable displays as well as carnival rides, stunt shows - and the inevitable show bag pavillion.","The 2015 Sydney Royal Easter show opened to the public last Thursday 26 .

5202,e650af070a5c7a76985fbecaa78c89dbdfef6312,"The Rev. Robert H. Schuller, the Southern California televangelist and author who beamed his upbeat messages on faith and redemption to millions from his landmark Crystal Cathedral only to see his empire crumble in his waning years, has died. He was 88. Schuller died early Thursday at a care facility in Artesia, daughter Carol Schuller Milner said. In 2013, he was diagnosed with a tumor in his esophagus that had spread to his lymph nodes and began treatment. Once a charismatic and well-known presence on the televangelist circuit, Schuller faded from view in recent years after watching his church collapse amid a disastrous leadership transition and sharp declines in viewership and donations that ultimately forced the ministry to file for bankruptcy. The soaring, glass-paned Crystal Cathedral — the touchstone of Schuller's storied ministry — was sold to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange in 2011, and Schuller lost a legal battle the following year to collect more than $5 million from his former ministry for claims of copyright infringement and breach of contract. Scroll down for video . Minister: Rev. Robert H. Schuller  died early Thursday in California at the age of 88 . Beginnings: . He and his late wife, Arvella (seen together in 1950) started a ministry in 1955 with $500 when he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a drive-in movie theater southeast of Los Angeles . Schuller, who preached in a flowing purple robe and outsized aviator glasses, suffered a mild heart attack in 1997 but was quickly back on the pulpit, saying 'the positive person' is not afraid of life's surprises. In July 2013, he was hospitalized for days after a late-night fall at his home in Orange. Schuller's evangelical Protestant ministry, part of the Reformed Church in America, was a product of modern technology. He and his late wife, Arvella, an organist, started a ministry in 1955 with $500 when he began preaching from the roof of a concession stand at a drive-in movie theater southeast of Los Angeles. The church's motto — 'Come as you are in the family car' — tapped into the burgeoning Southern California auto culture and the suburban boom of post-World War II America. By 1961, the church had a brick-and-mortar home — a 'walk-in/drive-in church' — and Schuller began broadcasting the 'Hour of Power' in 1970. In 1980, he built the towering glass-and-steel Crystal Cathedral to house his booming TV ministry, which was broadcast live each week from the cathedral's airy and sunlit 2,800-seat sanctuary. At its peak, in the 1990s, the program had 20 million viewers in about 180 countries. Preaching: The Reverend Robert Schuller is seen here on January 28, 1996, urging John du Pont - whose life story was dramatized in the 2014 film 'Foxcatcher' to give up after killing Dave Schultz . Success: Schuller (seen in 1980) he built the Crystal Cathedral to house his booming TV ministry, which was broadcast live each week from the cathedral's airy and sunlit 2,800-seat sanctuary . Couple: Besides his son, Schuller and his wife, Arvella, had four daughters, Sheila, Jeanne, Carol and Gretchen. Arvella Schuller died Feb. 11, 2014, after a brief illness. The couple is seen together in 1997 . Schuller hailed from Iowa, and according to the Des Moines Register, once said 'To the degree I have been successful, I owe it to integrity. 'Integrity absolutely goes with the territory in Iowa. If you are a farmer in Iowa, you can't be dishonest. You aren't just passing through. You expect to be buried here.' Schuller's message — that 'Possibility Thinking' and love of God overcome hardships — was a uniquely American blend of Bible and psychology. It was inspired by late author Norman Vincent Peale, who wrote 'The Power of Positive Thinking.' Schuller also wrote more than 30 books, including several best-sellers. 'He was a young guy like me, and he was going out there and trying new things,' said his grandson, Bobby Schuller, who pastors his own church that includes some of his grandfather's former congregants. 'He did so many amazing, innovative things.' Unlike other televangelists, the senior Schuller's message lacked fire-and-brimstone condemnations or conservative political baggage. 'The classical error of historical Christianity is that we have never started with the value of the person. Rather, we have started from the 'unworthiness of the sinner,' and that starting point has set the stage for the glorification of human shame in Christian theology,' he wrote in his book 'Self-Esteem: The New Reformation.' Schuller had admirers that ranged from fellow evangelist Billy Graham to Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. He also was among the first foreign religious figures invited to preach on Russian television. Fundamentalists attacked him as a heretic and humanist for statements they believed denied the need for personal repentance of sin and for his tolerance of Jewish, Roman Catholic and other theologies. His friendship with President Bill Clinton raised some eyebrows among the conservative Republicans of his Orange County congregation and prompted a deluge of irate letters and telephone calls. In response, Schuller gave a sermon on tolerance. Family: In this 2010 file photo, Sheila Schuller Coleman, right, stands next to her father, Robert H. Schuller, as she delivers her sermon . Friendship: Schuller's friendship with President Clinton raised some eyebrows among the conservative Republicans of his Orange County congregation and prompted a deluge of irate letters and telephone calls (2006 file photo) 'I do let people know how great their sins and miseries are,' he said in a 1992 radio interview. 'I don't do that by standing in a pulpit and telling them they're sinners. ...The way I do it is ask questions. Are you happy? Do you have problems, what are they? So then I come across as somebody who cares about them.' Schuller sometimes cited the example of his daughter Carol, who lost part of her leg because of a motorcycle accident in 1978 but went on to become a champion skier. 'When tough times come, we need to take tough action, to hold on until the tide turns for the better, to tenaciously dig in and bloom where we are planted,' he wrote. Tough times were in store for Schuller, too. In 2006, Schuller's only son, 51-year-old Robert A. Schuller, was installed as senior pastor, the start of a carefully choreographed leadership transition. Although a father-son succession is rare in the Reformed Church in America, the Schullers considered the church a 'family business' and the move was sanctioned by the national church, officials said. Popular: At its peak, in the 1990s, the 'Hour of Power,' filmed at the Crsytal Cathedral, had 20 million viewers in about 180 countries . Guest: First lady Hillary Clinton stands in the audience before President Clinton's State of the Union Address Tuesday, Feb. 4, 1997, at the Capitol with Schuller . But the organization fell on difficult times after the younger Schuller's installation, and he left amid a bitter family feud in fall 2008. His father had removed him from the 'Hour of Power' broadcasts, and he quit as senior pastor a few weeks later. Sheila Schuller Coleman, one of Schuller's daughters, took over as the church's top administrator, and a stable of preachers, including her and her father, handled preaching duties on the 'Hour of Power.' She, too, ultimately left, taking some congregants with her to start a new ministry. The tumult in the pulpit worsened a pre-existing decline in viewership and donations, and in 2010, Crystal Cathedral ministries filed for bankruptcy, citing debt of more than $43 million. Bankruptcy filings indicated the ministry was paying significant tax-exempt housing allowances to Schuller family members and insiders. The allowances were legal but raised concerns among vendors and other creditors who had gone unpaid for months. In 2012, Schuller and his wife quit the board of directors in a dispute over copyright infringement and breach of contract. That same year, they lost a legal bid to recover more than $5 million from their former ministry. Schuller's grandson, Bobby Schuller, took the remaining congregation and founded a new church. Bobby Schuller also took over the 'Hour of Power,' broadcasting from a new location. Bobby Schuller tweeted Wednesday 'My Grandfather Robert H. Schuller passed this morning into eternal life with Christ.' 'My father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning,' Donna Schuller tweeted. 'He was a great Dad and a great man of God.' She earlier told the Orange County Register 'He was talking normally a couple of months ago. But since the [digestive tract] procedure, he was whispering. And later, he could barely mouth words.' She told the newspaper before his death 'He doesn't seem to be in pain. He's had a wonderful life and he’ll pass gracefully.' Robert Harold Schuller was born in Alton, Iowa, in 1926, and was ordained by the Reformed Church in America in 1950. He was pastor of Ivanhoe Reformed Church in Chicago from 1950 to 1955 before moving to California. Besides his son, Schuller and his wife, Arvella, had four daughters, Sheila, Jeanne, Carol and Gretchen. Arvella Schuller died Feb. 11, 2014, after a brief illness.","The Rev. Robert H.

Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, the owner of the Three network, to let its users make calls and send texts in any country at no extra cost. Industry sources said the firms are discussing a 'wholesale access agreement' that would help Google create a global network . Customers would then be able to use this global network to make calls, send texts and use data as part of their plan, regardless of where in the world they are. In particular, a deal with Hutchison would extend the service to the UK, Ireland, Italy and Spain., but the plans would only affect the small base of customers on Google's plan. Last week Three extending its Feel at Home scheme to Spain and New Zealand. Feel at Home lets Three customers use their phones, and their plans, in the same way they can at home even when they're in a foreign country. Spain and New Zealand take the total number of Feel at Home countries to 18. The other nations include France, Switzerland, Israel, Norway, Sri Lanka, Australia, Finland, Indonesia, Macau, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden, Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and the USA. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home that lets customers use their phones and their plans in 18  countries. Google's vice president Sundar Pichai confirmed rumours his firm was launching a mobile network plan during during a talk at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. It will be initially offered to cities that have Google Fiber, such as Kansas, Texas and Utah and Google is working with network operators on developing the cellular plan. ‘You will see us announce it in the coming months, I think we are at a stage where it is important to think about hardware, software and connectability together,’ said the 43-year-old. The rumours of a Google mobile network plan first emerged in April last year. Instead of building masts, Google will buy access to existing 3G and 4G networks at wholesale prices and sell the connectivity back to customers at a cheaper rate. Three already offers a similar scheme called Feel at Home (pictured) that lets customers use their phones and their plans for free, in 18 countries. Spain and New Zealand were the latest countries to join this scheme . A mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) is a company that offers mobile service plans using existing networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use this access to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Lycamobile in the U.S, for example, is an MVNO because it runs on T-Mobile’s network. In the UK, Tesco Mobile shares O2’s, and ultimately Telefonica’s, networks. An MVNO is typically run as an independent company, with its own staff and customer service . This would make Google a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) similar to Lycamobile in the US that runs on T-Mobile’s network, and Tesco Mobile in the UK which shares O2’s networks. MVNOs don't own the infrastructure the networks are built on. Instead, they buy access to parts of these networks at wholesale prices. The company can then use these network to run its own wireless plans and resell the connectivity back to customers - usually at a reduced rate. Mr Pinchai said: ‘We want to be able to experiment along those lines, [but] we don't intend to be a network operator at scale.’ He described the plans as a ‘project’ and will do it on a small enough scale to not threaten existing networks. In particular, Mr Pichai said the setup should provide at seamless connection between Wi-Fi and mobile networks.

Travelex has launched a 'Supercard' that makes fees charged by banks for using your card abroad a thing of the past. Based on an average 10-day holiday, Travelex told MailOnline a family of four could save almost £110. The Supercard looks and works like a standard debit card, but it connects to an app and lets users consolidate multiple cards onto one account. The banking fees are paid for by Travelex and savings are shown in real-time. And if a card is lost or stolen it can be blocked using the app. In 2013, the firm announced it was expanding the service to Austin in Texas, Provo in Utah and a number of other towns in Missouri and California. More locations are due to be added later this year, but the roll-out is slow because Google has to install the relevant infrastructure needed. Google Fiber starts at $70 (£42) a month and has been praised for offering high speeds at relatively low prices. Google’s wireless plans would remove some of the costs, and time spent, in setting up its own network and it would equally benefit from using already established and well-connected networks. This could help Google cement itself as an internet service provider. Google could additionally use the network to sell its Nexus range of phones, for example, with contract or service plans.","Google is said to be in talks with Hutchison Whampoa, which owns Three .

Twelve jurors and twelve alternates are on the list. The group includes 19 women and five men. It's almost entirely white and mostly middle-aged. It's a key step in the case, and it's been a long time coming. Jury selection started in January with 9,000 potential jurors. But the legal wrangling is the case is just revving up. Holmes' defense attorneys asked for a change of venue after the jury was seated Tuesday. The judge denied their request, noting that a jury had already been seated. Opening statements in the trial are scheduled to begin on April 27. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and injuring 70 others when he allegedly opened fire inside a packed theater during the midnight showing of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" on July 20, 2012. The one-time neuroscience doctoral student faces 165 counts, including murder and attempted murder charges. Now 27, he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. If convicted of the most serious charges, he could face a death sentence. Wearing a gray dress shirt and tan slacks, Holmes sat quietly in court on Tuesday, looking relaxed and leaning back in his chair for much of the day as lawyers made their picks from the jury pool.

11230,b59702e1f785a166fb274eb1492e91e54e44357b,"In the heart of Yellowstone National Park, a supervolcano releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day. But the magma chamber lying directly beneath its surface is not considered large enough to produce such levels, so researchers have been searching for an alternative source for years. Now, by tracking seismic waves, a team of geophysicists has discovered an enormous secondary chamber deeper underground that's so large its partly-molten rock could fill the Grand Canyon 11 times over. Scroll down for video . A supervolcano in Yellowstone National Park (pictured) releases around 45,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide each day. A magma chamber beneath the surface is not considered large enough to produce these levels and now researchers have found the source in a secondary magma chamber deeper underground . The Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. Silicic is used to describe magma or igneous rock rich in silica. It is situated in Yellowstone National Park - which spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago. The Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. It is situated in Yellowstone National Park - which spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana - and last erupted 640,000 years ago. Although lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago, the researchers said. Experts say there is a one in 700,000 annual chance of a volcanic eruption at the site. Previous research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, directly beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km). To discover the latest chamber, Hsin-Hua Huang from the University of Utah and colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes. The researchers said the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock. The remaining 2 per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption. It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km). Lava has flowed in the area as recently as 70,000 years ago, researchers added.

To discover the latest chamber, Hsin-Hua Huang from the University of Utah and his colleagues  tracked seismic waves from almost 5,000 earthquakes. These readings combined data from the University of Utah Seismograph Stations, which collected shallow readings from nearby quakes in Utah, Idaho, the Teton Range and Yellowstone, and from the Earthscope array, which revealed deeper readings from temblors from more further afield. Each of these quakes created waves that echoed around the supervolcano. The movement and structure of these waves could then be used to map the earth beneath. The researchers said in their paper: 'The Yellowstone magmatic system from the mantle plume to the upper crust', published in the journal Science, that the reservoir contains around 98 per cent hot rock. The remaining two per cent is molten rock and is too deep to directly cause an eruption, they added. It sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the supervolcano and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km). To put this into perspective, the Grand Canyon in Arizona has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles (4,168 cubic km) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber would fill it two-and-a-half times, and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times. Previous research found a relatively small magma chamber, known as the upper-crustal magma reservoir, beneath the surface in 2013 that measures 2,500 cubic miles (10,420 cubic km). The latest chamber sits 12 to 28 miles (19 to 45km) beneath the surface and measures 11,035 cubic miles (46,000 cubic km) (illustrated) To discover the large chamber (shown in yellow), the University of Utah tracked seismic waves from 5,000 earthquakes. Each of these quakes created waves that 'echoed' around the supervolcano. The smaller magma chamber is shown in red beneath the supervolcano's caldera . Researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three Yellowstone eruptions 2 million, 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago. If Yellowstone did erupt, estimates from a National Geographic report said its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly. A 10-foot (3 metre) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles (1,610km), leaving two-thirds of the US uninhabitable. This spread of volcanic ash, rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe. Not only do the findings reveal what is causing the high levels of carbon dioxide, researchers can use it to learn more about how the supervolcano connects to the hot-spot plume in Earth's mantle. It could also provide clues about the structure of other supervolcanoes. 'An understanding of its properties is key to enhancing our knowledge of volcanic mechanisms and corresponding risk,' said the researchers. 'This lower-crustal magma body has a volume 4.5 times larger than the upper-crustal magma reservoir [and] these estimates are critical to understanding the evolution of basaltic-rhyolitic volcanism and explaining the magnitude of CO2 discharge.' The presence of magma reservoirs underlying upper crust magma chambers has been inferred at other locations, but not detected. The paper added that the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three Yellowstone eruptions 2 million, 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago. The Yellowstone supervolcano is one of the largest active continental silicic volcanic fields in the world. Researchers said the upper magma chamber is believed to have been the source of three Yellowstone eruptions 2 million, 1.2 million and 640,000 years ago . Yellowstone National Park spans the midwestern US states of Wyoming, Idaho and Montana (pictured) If Yellowstone did erupt, estimates from National Geographic suggest its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly. A 10-foot (3 metre) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles (1,610km), leaving two-thirds of the US uninhabitable. This spread of volcanic ash, rocks and gas would then prevent planes from taking off and disrupt air travel around the globe. 'The magma chamber and reservoir are not getting any bigger than they have been, it's just that we can see them better now using new techniques,' added co-author Jamie Farrell, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Utah. For comparison, the Grand Canyon in Arizona (pictured) has a volume of 1,000 cubic miles (4,168 cubic km) meaning the molten rock in the upper chamber of Yellowstone would fill it two-and-a-half times, and the rock from the larger lower chamber would fill it 11 times . If Yellowstone (pictured) erupted, estimates suggest its immediate effects would kill around 87,000 instantly. A 10-foot (3 metre) layer of ash would travel around 1,000 miles (1,610km), leaving two-thirds of the US uninhabitable. And this spread of volcanic ash, rocks and gas would then  disrupt air travel around the globe .","Researchers used seismic readings to map what is beneath Yellowstone .

2127,d6bbbfa9b5c58e99d21d549a9fb5b512b342e301,"Garissa, Kenya (CNN)First came the gunshots. Then the footsteps, as Al-Shabaab militants followed her into her dorm room. Cynthia Cheroitich went into a closet, covering herself with clothes. Her two roommates hid under their beds, until the gunmen called them out. ""(The gunmen) told them if you don't know to read to them in the Muslim word, whatever, and then you lie down,"" Cheroitich told CNN. ""And then, if you know, you go to the other side."" The 19-year-old student at Kenya's Garissa University College didn't see what happened next, but she heard more than enough. ""They were shooting everywhere,"" she said. ""I didn't want to open my eyes."" For the next two days, Cheroitich didn't budge. Unable to get to water, she hydrated by drinking body lotion. When police went into her room -- well after the carnage was done, with 147 dead at the school -- she didn't believe them. Only a visit by the head of the university convinced her that, finally, it was safe to come out. ""I was scared so much,"" she recalled. Cheroitich's survival story, which she recounted to CNN on Saturday, is a rare bright spot in what has been a horrific week in Garissa, a town about 90 miles from the Somali border, and throughout Kenya. It is all due to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist extremist group that is based in Somalia but hasn't confined its terrorism to there -- as evidenced by Thursday's university attack and the 2013 siege of Nairobi's upscale Westgate Mall. Saturday, the terrorist group warned that more carnage is coming as it promised ""another bloodbath"" in Kenya. The threat drew a sharp response from Nadif Jama, the governor of Garissa county. ""The fallacy and satanic mindset of Al-Shabaab is that in Somalia, they kill Muslims and Somalis,"" Jama said. ""They cross the border here and then say they are killing non-Muslims. That is a tricky way of doing business."" Jama said the militants were ""bent on nothing but destruction"" and aimed to sow division between Muslims and non-Muslims. ""But that is something we need to fight,"" Jama said. Police in Garissa on Saturday paraded the bodies of men they said had carried out the attack. The corpses -- locked in a macabre embrace and partially wrapped in an orange tarp -- were piled on the back of a pickup truck and driven to a primary school soccer pitch for viewing. A large crowd gathered, despite the baking sun and foul stench. The truck drove up next to the onlookers, so that they could inspect the bodies. Anger seethed in the crowd. ""These gunmen, they killed innocent children. We want to burn these people,"" one man told CNN. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta also had some harsh words Saturday for Al-Shabaab, as well as any those who supported them. Five arrested in Kenya attack . In a nationally televised speech, Kenyatta said the nation's fight against terrorism ""has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and the financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities and were seen previously as ordinary, harmless people."" Kenyatta condemned ""corruption of the worst and most criminal kind (when) Kenyans ... finance, hide and recruit on behalf of Al-Shabaab."" ""There is no form of legal penalty, social shaming and godly condemnation that they do not deserve, to the fullest extent,"" the President said. Describing Al-Shabaab as an ""existential threat to our republic,"" Kenyatta urged his fellow Kenyans to ""tell those that believe a caliphate is possible in Kenya that we are one indivisible, sovereign and democratic state."" ""That fight will never change,"" he added. ""Our forefathers bled and died for this nation. And we will do everything to defend our way of life."" Kenyatta declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the attack. Inside Garissa University College dorm's scene of slaughter . Christian Purefoy reported from Garissa.

3100,001ebaa80dca4a65adf2178b132113cb9e3d5431,"Justin Rose will try to take a leaf out of Rory McIlroy's book after kickstarting his season with his share of second place in the Masters. Rose arrived at Augusta National having missed the cut in three of his previous five tournaments on the PGA Tour, but left with renewed enthusiasm and a 14-under-par total which has only been bettered six times in Masters history. 'I'm really excited about the rest of the year now. It's a good momentum starter for me,' said Rose, who was looking to become the first European player to win the US Open and Masters. Justin Rose was unable to take victory at the Masters, despite carding 14-under-par for the tournament . Rose believes that his finish of second at Augusta can boost his season with some big events ahead . Rose wants to follow the lead of Rory McIlroy, who had a relentless winning streak in the summer of 2014 . 'I tried to really tell myself that this year for me is going to be about April to September when the big tournaments come around and that's when I want to play well. 'You look at Rory's year last year, it was all about how he played in the summer (winning the Open, Bridgestone Invitational and US PGA in the space of four weeks). I was trying to keep telling myself it's a long year. Very happy it turned around this week in a major championship. 'The thing that was most important for me this week was the fact that I have not been in contention and I haven't had a lot of experience this year or positive vibes on which to draw. 'I was really pleased at how comfortable I felt in that situation, last group in the Masters on Sunday. I think that's when you learn a lot about yourself and that makes me very hungry to get there again very soon.' Rose began the final round four shots behind Spieth and closed to within three on three separate occasions on the front nine, but was never able to get any closer. 'There's two ways to look at it. You can think that 14 under par, I'll take that next year and I'll take that the year after and I'll take it the year after, so I have to take a lot of confidence from that,' he added. Rose had struggled to hit top form going into the Masters but now hopes to sustain his Augusta form . Rose (left) congratulates tournament winner Spieth and praised his performance level for the week . 'But you've got to play it on the day, too. I felt like there were a few moments out there where I could have done better and I'll learn on that and think about that. 'Jordan didn't really open the door and I didn't really expect him to. Really the one time on the back nine where it got interesting for me was the 16th hole. I felt that if I make my birdie putt and Jordan misses for par, it's a two-shot swing and I'm two back with two to play. But my putt just slid by and he made a great eight- footer to there to keep his momentum as he did all day, really.'","Justin Rose finished joint runner-up at the Masters 2015 on 14-under-par .

9424,9f2dbe8953dd5b1d2b0f2f748c51bfccbe72906e,"A new sexual technique that aims to teach women how to 'expand the sweet spot' experienced during orgasm has swept into the UK. Orgasmic meditation, shortened to OM, is a practice that marries sex with mindfulness and, according to its founders, encourages 'connection, vitality and wellness' and 'cultivates a greater connection' between partners. The practice, which was founded by US entrepreneur Nicole Daedone, borrows much of its philosophy from yoga and meditation. Director of OneTaste, Justine Dawson (seated on the sofa), is shown guiding a couple through orgasmic meditation, which aims to teach couples how to enable women to orgasm more deeply . Orgasmic meditation involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption . According to teachers of OM, it involves the light stimulation of a woman's clitoris for 15 minutes without interruption. The aim is not necessarily to orgasm but simply to 'feel' the sensation as intensely as possible. Usually practiced in pairs, there is a 'strokee' and a 'stroker'. OM-ing affects the same parts of the human brain as conventional meditation. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the US in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. There are also 30 dedicated orgasmic meditation centres across the globe. OM can be led in classes or with an individual trainer, if those attending desire a more private setting. In the classes, which cost £195 for a seven-hour session, attendees can be couples or singles. The director of the US company OneTaste, which has brought the sessions to the UK via affiliate company TurnON Britain, says the demographic on classes are surprisingly mixed. Justine Dawson told FEMAIL: 'All kinds of people come to the courses - people in their 20s through their 70s and even into their 80s. She continues: '[It's a mixture of] Singles and couples. Some couples who have been together for a year, others for 30 years. There are all kinds of professional backgrounds - doctors, teachers, programmers, managers, artists, therapists. 'I would say that most people are 25-55, 70 per cent are single, 30 per cent are couples. All who come share a common desire to experience greater connection in their lives.' Your average Brit might find the thought of disrobing in front of others for such an intimate encounter mortifying but Dawson believes that most people can get over the embarrassment if they feel they're gaining a valuable experience. She says: 'When it comes to discussions of orgasm, relationship and connection, I believe that most people are shy. 'But people come to the class regardless, because they know that good things take practice and just like your health or career, it's worth putting time and effort into your sex and relationships, even if it means being a little uncomfortable!' The aim of the £195 class is to help women prolong the 'sweet spot' when orgasming. There are currently 2,000 people  practicing the method in the UK, according to Turn On Britain . Director of US company OneTaste, Justine Dawson, says her aspirations for the practice are that it becomes second nature to mention OM alongside yoga and meditation . A video from a private class in London, led by Justine Dawson, shows a woman lying on a towel with a pillow behind her head. She is naked from the waist down and a partner sits on the floor by her side. Dawson, who's been teaching OM for eight years, explains: 'It's a 15 minute partner practice that two people can do together to increase connection, vitality, wellness and to cultivate a greater connection between them. 'A woman takes off her pants and lies down. Her partner sits next to her and lightly and deliberately strokes her clitoris for 15 minutes.' Dawson thinks the attraction for OM is that it offers a more conscious approach to sex and relationships. 'I believe there is a growing trend for the practice because our culture as a whole is ready for something different than the sex and relationships that have been ""on the menu"" up until now. She adds: 'We're ready for a different approach. One that is more conscious. People want information on how to do that. And we offer it openly.' Dawson also leads a team of teachers, holding monthly public sessions of up to 50 people in which couples are shown a demonstration, and then can partake themselves. She says she became an OM teacher out of personal interest: 'As someone who had practiced meditation for many years, I was looking for a wellness practice that would enhance my connection with a partner, while deepening my connection to myself. 'As many wellness practices are done in silence or even solitude, I was curious for one that instead could be done in connection, in a way that would enliven my relationships. I started with a class and it turned into my career, much to my surprise.' She hopes that one day OM will be mentioned in the same breath as yoga or meditation, saying: 'Our vision is that people could equally say yoga, meditation, orgasmic meditation.' Orgasmic meditation founder Nicole Daedone hails from California. Before focusing her attentions on orgasmic meditation, the author and entrepreneur was a University Instructor in Semantics and Gender Communication. Daedone first taught orgasmic meditation in the USA in 2001 and since then the craze has spread around the world. There are currently over 10,000 practitioners worldwide and 2,000 in the UK alone. Vanity Fair named Daedone in its list of 'Twelve Women Who Changed the Way We Look at Sex' and around 900,000 people have viewed her  Ted talk, entitled Orgasm, the Cure for Hunger in Western Woman.","Orgasmic meditation (OM) helps to 'expand' women's climaxes .

Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyoncé Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her £3 million home. Beyoncé went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyoncé was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview – one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyoncé is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyoncé's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record – it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below).

Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity – what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful… it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible – I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story – we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'","Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is known as the 'celebrity whisperer' and hones talent .

7821,720e766e1018ca53756757f11e4c27aeac9374e2,"Ed and Justine Miliband first met at a dinner party, hosted by the woman he was 'secretly' dating . Relish the scene. A dinner party in West London. The hostess: Stephanie Flanders, the glamorous then economics editor of BBC2's Newsnight. The guests: young barristers and would-be politicians. Central to the party that night back in March 2004 was Flanders' boyfriend, Labour rising star Ed Miliband. At the time, he was chief economics adviser to the Chancellor, Gordon Brown. Miliband had been back in Britain for two months after a brief spell as a lecturer at Harvard University in the U.S. Ever the policy nerd, the son of a Marxist professor waxed lyrical about economic theory. As he held court, a young woman called Justine Thornton, who was sitting across the table and whom he had never met before, became transfixed. A clever young environmental lawyer, she had been invited by Stephanie — the brilliant daughter of Michael Flanders, of the Fifties and Sixties musical comedy duo Flanders & Swann. Yesterday, Justine recalled in a red-top newspaper: 'I thought he was good-looking and clever and seemed to be unattached. But we just went down a conversation cul-de-sac. Apparently we had nothing in common. 'He just wanted to talk about economics — one of my least favourite subjects. None of our conversations went anywhere.' Mrs Miliband said that she was 'furious' when — far from being 'unattached' — she found out that he was 'secretly going out with' the woman who had invited her for dinner. Fast-forward more than 11 years and the Milibands have since had two children, married and believe they are less than a month away from moving house with their family to No 10 Downing Street. But the story of the pair's first meeting offers a fascinating insight into the somewhat caddish character of the Labour Leader. Scroll down for video . For, not only did he knife his elder brother in the back by ending his dream of getting the Labour leadership by standing against him (contrary to the wishes of their mother), but he met his future wife Justine (albeit unwittingly) at that dinner party hosted by his then girlfriend. The story emerged yesterday when Mrs Miliband gave an interview to the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror. Clearly she was guided by Labour spin doctors, who wanted to give the impression to voters that her husband was a touchy-feely human being, rather than the soulless nerd that his awkward image conveys on TV. The simpering headline of the article ran: 'Ed bandaged me up after I was bitten by a Doberman . . . and I fell in love.' Justine told how, during the 2005 election campaign, Ed had come to her rescue after she was bitten by the dog. It happened when they were putting leaflets through letter-boxes in houses in Runcorn, Cheshire. 'Ed bandaged me and I fell in love with him,' said Justine. Former partners of Mr Miliband include Juliet Soskice (left) and fellow political aide Liz Lloyd (right) After their first meeting at that 2004 dinner party, it was at least a year before they started dating. Justine's recollection isn't, though, the first public airing of her love story with Ed. In the biography of the Labour leader, titled Ed: The Milibands And The Making Of A Labour Leader, an associate is quoted as saying: 'Although she was struck by his eyes — wide and brown and fixed on their subject — a friend remembers her undoubted excitement after meeting Ed as: 'Gosh, how fascinating, he's really clever', rather than: 'Gosh, how handsome'.' Perhaps glossing over what may be seen as such caddish behaviour, the Daily Mirror omitted to say that the dinner's hostess, Stephanie Flanders (who later left the BBC for a £400,000-a-year job at a bank in the City), was Ed's then girlfriend. It was left to Tony Blair's biographer John Rentoul to let the cat out of the bag after reading the Mirror story, when he tweeted: 'Justine on clandestine Ed. Why has Mirror not named the host of that dinner? It was Stephanie Flanders.' Stephanie Flanders (pictured), a former girlfriend of Mr Miliband, hosted the dinner party where he first met his future wife . Considering that she, at the time, was economics editor of BBC-TV's flagship Newsnight, Rentoul added: 'Could the secrecy have been because he was a Treasury special adviser and Stephanie Flanders was a BBC economics journalist?' What's more, there is another intriguing twist to this story of high politics and high economics. For two years ago, Ed Miliband ungallantly blurted out, during an interview with a celebrity magazine, that not only had he romanced Stephanie but that his close Labour colleague and Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls, had had a relationship with her, too. Miliband said: 'We did both date her but there was a long time apart between me and Ed. Stephanie and I don't have any problems running into each other now.' For her part, Stephanie had no forewarning of Miliband's revelation and restricted her response to curtly dismissing her relationship with him as having been 'very brief and a very long time ago'. However, her relationship with Balls, a decade earlier, was more serious. They met in 1989 at Harvard University, where they were both Kennedy scholars after having graduated from Oxford University. It was while they were working at the Financial Times as leader writers that their friendship blossomed into a serious relationship. The way these relationships intertwined also highlights the deeply incestuous and narrow world of the Labour high command. For it wasn't just Miliband and Balls, but others, too, who had close personal relationships. Of course, Balls is now married to fellow Shadow Cabinet Minister Yvette Cooper. All four studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE) at Oxford University. Cooper and Flanders were tutorial partners and Kennedy scholars at Harvard. Miliband also studied at Harvard. Cooper once shared a house with Miliband (who apparently had a few other girlfriends). And she met Balls when they both worked at the FT. But back to Ed Miliband's tangled love-life. For several years in the mid-1990s, when he was working as an adviser to the then-Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown, he went out with fellow political aide, Liz Lloyd (a Cambridge graduate). She worked for a time for Tony Blair, who described her in his memoirs as 'an English rose, intellectually able and blue stocking or red stocking according to the occasion'. In the summer of 1995, she and Miliband went on holiday to the south of France. They stayed in the family home of one of Miliband's first girlfriends, Juliet Soskice (the daughter of an LSE political economist and who went on to marry the late tycoon Andrew Rosenfeld, who gave £1 million to the Labour Party). At the time, Juliet was dating the Blairite journalist Phil Collins (who went on to write speeches for Blair). It was clearly a busman's holiday, as much of the discussion among the group was about the national minimum wage which was a New Labour policy. After breaking up with Liz Lloyd, Mr Miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist Alice Miles (pictured) 'We discussed it like we were in a Fabian Society seminar,' recalled Collins. 'I remember being in the kitchen and listening to Ed having a conversation about it in real detail.' Miliband's relationship with Lloyd continued when Blair became PM. Her job at No 10 meant she sat next to her lover's elder brother David Miliband, who was a key figure in the Downing Street policy unit. After breaking up with Lloyd, Ed Miliband had a brief relationship with the journalist Alice Miles, who then worked for The Times. Ms Miles, who some years later became a single parent, also had a fling with her then coke-snorting Times colleague Tom Baldwin, who is now Miliband's chief spin doctor. What a deliciously small and privileged world! One that is a million miles from the lives of millions of ordinary voters. And so back to Red Ed and Justine. The next time they met after his questionable behaviour at his then girlfriend Stephanie Flanders' dinner party was in the months leading up to him becoming an MP. Later, she helped campaign for him in Doncaster during the 2005 election by moving chairs around for a public meeting. No more Mr Nerd: Justine's interview in yesterday's Labour-supporting Mirror . Some months after, Justine planned a holiday with a woman barrister friend, Quincy Whitaker, to Libya to see the Roman ruins. However, after it was booked, Justine said she wanted to go, instead, with Ed Miliband. Their relationship had consolidated further by the time Miliband was appointed Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change in the Brown government.

Kyle Major, from Blackpool, Lancashire, followed his victim - who had just asked his group of friends for directions - and felled him from behind with a punch to the back of the head. Paul Walker, 52, was thought to be unconscious before his chin hit the ground and died shortly afterwards in hospital. Kyle Major, 14, punched father-of-two Paul Walker (right) in the back of the head after wishing him a happy New Year. The court heard the boy had been 'allowed to run wild' The court heard how he had been found face down in a pool of blood by a passerby in the early hours of New Year’s Day this year, and that his hands were still in his pockets when paramedics arrived. Sentenced at Preston Crown Court today, Major, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter at an earlier hearing, was ordered to be detained for three years. The Recorder of Preston, Judge Anthony Russell QC, lifted reporting restrictions on naming the juvenile following an application that the public interest in identifying him outweighed the child’s welfare. Teenager Kyle Major cowardly killed father of two Paul Walker in the early hours of New Year's Day . Major followed his victim who had just asked his group of friends for directions and felled him from behind with a single punch to the back of the head. The court heard that Mr Walker, described by his family as 'a lovely man with a big heart', had lost his way in the resort after leaving his sister’s New Year’s Eve party 'in good spirits'. He came across a group of youths in the street in Sutton Place who told him where he was, including Major who was heard to wish him 'Happy New Year'. Moments later the defendant and a male friend followed Mr Walker. Major ran off after felling Mr Walker and later texted another friend: 'I’m scared. Don’t want to go to jail. Two/four years. Don’t say anything.' He initially denied any involvement in the attack when arrested. Mr Walker was described by his family in the court room as a 'lovely man with a big heart' The court heard that Major, of Devonshire Road, had consumed six bottles of Budweiser lager and a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey on the night. He regularly drank to excess and was also an habitual user of cannabis. The teenager already had seven previous convictions for non-violent offences such as burglary and theft. Major consumed six bottles of Budweiser lager and a quarter of a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey on the night . Major regularly drank to excess, smoked cannabis, was in foster care and had seven previous convictions . He had been under the supervision of a youth offending team since December 2013 following various court orders but his response was said to have been “poor” and he was described in reports as acting in 'a reckless and carefree manner' with no regard to the consequences to himself or others. Currently in foster care, Major’s parenting was said to be 'out-of-control'. Judge Russell said that Mr Walker had been 'vulnerable' and possibly unsteady on his feet. 'The blow was of significant force to knock a large man down. You had no thought for what you were doing at the time. 'You have a criminal record and you have shown until this matter came to light no inclination to mend your ways or respond positively. 'You were responsible for the loss of this decent man, a loss for which the family will never recover. Your upbringing has been unfortunate and you have been allowed to run wild.'","Kyle Major killed Paul Walker with a single punch to the back of his head .

7541,8c899a56faed1e6a5d5933bc5fed04e6d3df5863,"It was, as so often this season, the story of two Chelsea rising stars in the form of their young lives. They have rampaged through opposition defences both at home and abroad all season. They have already been crowned kings of Europe in the UEFA Youth League. And here, with yet another devastating performance, they put Chelsea within touching distance of retaining the FA Youth Cup, in the process further augmenting their remarkable goalscoring tallies and enhancing their growing reputations. Tammy Abraham wheels away in celebration as he notches for Chelsea away at Manchester City in the FA Youth Cup final first leg . Chelsea striker Abraham opens the scoring against Manchester with an impressive right-footed shot into the far corner . Isaac Buckley-Ricketts is mobbed by his Manchester City team-mates following his equaliser against Chelsea in the Youth Cup . Abraham is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates as his acrobatic effort regained their advantage against Manchester City . Abraham is congratulated by his Chelsea team-mates having given the west London side the lead against Manchester City . After Manchester City were put to the sword in this first leg on Monday night, the pair’s records for the season stand like this: Tammy Abraham - 36 goals; Dominic Solanke - 35 goals. That’s one hell of a return. Both are in that special moment of form where it is nigh on impossible to miss and that was the case here as the dark Blues from London established a healthy advantage to take into the second leg at Stamford Bridge in seven days’ time. When Solanke had raced through to make it 3-1 just before the end, you sensed it was a fatal blow. Of course there is a chance City may fight back - nothing is out of the question in youth football - but there was something about Chelsea’s dominance here that suggests it is unlikely. This was the most high-profile meeting yet of England’s two most ambitious and well-resourced academies and, for the moment, it is definitely Chelsea who are on top. Another tickertape parade surely awaits for this group of players next week. ‘Obviously it’s a daunting place to come,’ said Chelsea coach Joe Edwards. ‘But we wanted to make sure we did what we do best, dominate possession, get right up against them and press hard. The way the lads implemented what we spoke about before the game was outstanding.’ Indeed it was and the unfailing right boot of Abraham provided a moment to savour after just seven minutes. Even the technically fiendish chances are flying in for the unstoppable England under 18 forward at the moment and that was proven when he controlled Charlie Colkett’s laser-guided cross-field pass and sent the ball arrowing beyond goalkeeper Christian Haug into the top corner. Within minutes, Abraham was trending on Twitter, clips of his immaculate hit racking up the retweets the world over. By half-time, his name was attracting more interest in the UK than any other subject. By then he had a second, restoring Chelsea’s lead on 20 minutes after Isaac Buckley had briefly restored parity for the hosts. Goal No 36 of the campaign wasn’t quite as memorable as No 35 but it was athletic, Abraham hooking the ball home from six yards out after Izzy Brown’s header from a Colkett corner had been saved by the foot of Haug and then headed back into his vicinity. From then, aside from a five-minute flurry late on when City had genuine chances to equalise, Chelsea were in complete command. They enjoyed the lion’s share of possession and looked comfortable in their game plan, in each other and in themselves. Chelsea youngster Dominic Solanke scores the west London side's third goal of the game with just minutes to play . Manchester City goalkeeper Christian Kjetil Haug comes under pressure from Chelsea as both sides look to win the aerial ball . Solanke’s late third was a hammer blow after the City pressure, a typically calm finish after Charly Musonda slipped him through. It had actually been a quiet night for Solanke but this goal preserves his remarkable record of scoring in every round of this season’s Youth Cup. Incidentally, he also scored in every round of their Youth League triumph too for good measure. City, who were watched by Manuel Pellegrini, Vincent Kompany, Aleksander Kolarov and a near-full house at their handsome Academy Stadium, had levelled within two minutes of Abraham’s opener. Chelsea were guilty of a lapse in defensive concentration very unlike them and City swept through to punish.

Scorers: Abraham 7, 20; Solanke 89 . Referee: Robert Madley (West Yorkshire) Attendance: 6,421 . Brandon Barker spent much of the first-half struggling in his battle with Ola Aina on the City left but on this occasion, he dived in-field and made a purposeful run in the direction of the Chelsea box. Looking up, he saw Buckley darting through and supplied a slide-rule pass that the forward slickly rolled past Bradley Collins into the far corner. But they didn't kick on and seize control. Abraham’s exertions eventually took their toll and he went off in some discomfort midway through the second-half. It proved the catalyst for a City revival and the chances missed in this bright spell would prove costly. First, Aaron Nemane nutmegged Jake Clarke-Salter and brushed off Ruben Sammut but blazed wastefully wide. And there was soon an even-better chance for Kean Bryan, who stole the ball from Colkett, but fired over from a great position. They ramped it up further with Barker running clear down the left and forcing Collins to block with his feet. A minute or two later, Solanke scored. Edwards was proud of the performance but still exercised a note of caution: ‘We got the goal on the break, Dominic was very clinical and I think that 3-1 scoreline doesn’t overly flatter us because their spell was just a spell in amongst a game we dominated. ‘We don’t need to be reminded that you need to be switched on and professional next week.’ His City counterpart Jason Wilcox was bullish about the chances of a comeback: ‘It’s definitely not game over, we’ll go down to Stamford Bridge and anything can happen down there. If we get a goal, we’ll see what character they’ve got. At 3-1 we’re still in the tie.' But for that to happen, they’ll have to neutralise Chelsea’s relentless, remorseless forward duo.

1479,303537834925ad196de6ea49f1be13a0c54aaa93,"Somehow, to the backdrop of supporter unrest, protests and a worst-ever start to a Premier League season, Alan Pardew managed to excavate five straight victories from a Newcastle side which ranks as their most uninspiring of recent years. Many fans may be loath to admit as much – others readily do – but without that freakish run manufactured by an embattled Pardew, they would be headed for a second relegation in seven seasons. Remove those five wins and United would have just 20 points – the autumn run, then, has saved them from the fall. Alan Pardew's five-game winning run was crucial to Newcastle's season, who would only be on 20 points . Newcastle's fans protested for the board to sack Pardew as manager and were delighted when he resigned . When Pardew quit for Crystal Palace at the end of December, Newcastle were ninth. They were seven points off fourth and 10 from danger. Today – on the back of six consecutive defeats - they are lucky that seven points still separate them from the bottom three, while the gap to fourth has extended to 29. The 35 points on which they currently reside will probably be enough to renew their top-flight status. Pardew won 26 of those. Three weeks before embarking on that winning stretch, Pardew had appeared on the brink of dismissal. Behind the scenes, owner Mike Ashley was never going to dispense with his manager on the say-so of fan fury. Nonetheless, Pardew cut a resigned and wounded figure following a 1-0 defeat at Stoke which left Newcastle joint bottom with Burnley. Since his departure the players have look uninterested and unhappy playing for the club and John Carver . From the negativity, however, was born a perverse positivity, driven by Pardew’ s determination to repair a reputation so badly stained that his next posting would surely have been outside of the Premier League. Crucially, he kept his players on side – no mean feat given their current levels of disinterest – and so emerged a siege mentality which, on reflection, was to yield a season-saving 15 points. Reputation restored, Pardew’s exit plan was in place. He’d had enough of playing politician, caught at the centre of a toxic relationship between Ashley and the club’s fanbase. The 53-year-old appeared to have hit rock bottom against Stoke but picked up the players for the winning run . Replacement John Carver – like Pardew, the sole public face of the crisis club – is discovering just how poisonous that atmosphere has become. It has now permeated a playing staff which, like the thousands of supporters who boycotted Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs, have failed to turn up for the best part of 2015. Pardew, of course, was not without some serious flaws, and it was he who presided over six straight losses last season. But in his absence the club has begun to unravel. The squad has shown its true colours – a depressing grey which lacks energy, passion and invention. Carver is proving he's not cut out for top-level management, with two wins in the last 14 games . This sad situation, however, is the cause of a hierarchy which has stripped the club of ambition and meaning. With each passing defeat and demonstration, it becomes more apparent that perhaps Pardew was not the problem. In fact, without him, their problems could have been far worse.","Newcastle would be on 20 points if Alan Pardew's five wins were removed .

2906,43bb6a8aaa530696079fbb8b4fc39a73eaa7806b,"Oxford women made history on Saturday with a 12th boat race victory in 16 years on a landmark day for the sport. For the first time in 88 years the women’s race was staged on the famous Tideway course that for so long had been the sole preserve of the men. Hot favourites Oxford romped to victory by six and a half lengths against Cambridge, as the women struck a telling blow for sporting equality in racing the same championship course on the same day as the men. Ansastaia Chitty lifts the trophy aloft after Oxford won the boat race, easing past Cambridge on the Thames . On the day the Oxford sides shared the race route for the first time, they also shared the exact same winning margin, with the men going on to triumph in their race shortly afterwards. Oxford women’s president Anastasia Chitty hailed the victory as a special moment for her crew, but also for rowing and sporting equality overall. ‘It’s an amazing moment,’ Chitty told BBC Sport. ‘To pull something off like that is amazing. ‘To row on the same stage as the men, there were so many women before us who have never had this opportunity and it’s extremely humbling. We started moving away early on and kept ourselves ahead.’ The Oxford crew celebrate their win over Cambridge after dominating the race from start to finish . As the most decorated Olympic athlete ever to race in either boat race, Oxford stroke Caryn Davies underlined the quality on display in the women’s contest. The 32-year-old US Olympics team star boasts silver at Athens and gold medals at Beijing and London in the women’s eight — and now a boat race victory to boot. ‘I think that’s harder, I’ve got to be honest,’ Davies told BBC Sport when asked how the boat race compared to Olympic competition. The Oxford women's crew power to their win in the first women's boat race on the river Thames . ‘There was almost three times as long to suffer. But there’s always less suffering when you win! I’m just proud and honoured to have such attention. It shows how excited people are and I’m so glad we can be role models to young women everywhere.’ Oxford women finished in 19 minutes 45 seconds — 19 seconds ahead of Cambridge. Davies added: ‘I could just hear so many people cheering along the banks and it didn’t matter it they were cheering for Oxford or Cambridge. Just that they turned out was really great for us.’ After Oxford’s women breezed to victory, their male counterparts made it a Dark Blue double with victory in the 161st men’s race by an identical six and a half lengths. President Constantine Louloudis claimed a fourth and final boat race victory, completing a clean sweep only interrupted by claiming bronze with Team GB’s men’s eight at London 2012. The dark blues made a fast start and dominated the race against their Cambridge counterparts . Louloudis hailed the victory — Oxford’s 11th in the last 15 years — and admitted he felt far more pressure than before, despite his three previous wins. ‘I felt much more pressure this year, especially as I was leaving the guys,’ Louloudis told BBC Sport. ‘There were some pretty dark moments going in but I’m so pleased for the guys. We just stuck to our plan and executed a great race. ‘This was a fantastic performance. It is a relief to win as we were firm favourites. ‘Rio remains the long-term goal but this race was so important for me and all of us.’ They were true to form, surging ahead from the start. Despite being quickly pegged back, they powered ahead during the middle section to dominate the race, finishing in 17 minutes 34 seconds — winning by 19 seconds as Oxford’s women had before them. Crew member Michael DiSanto added: ‘We knew what we needed to do and we wanted to go down as one of the best Oxford crews ever.’ Louloudis lauded the achievements of the women’s boat on such a landmark occasion. ‘This was an historic day and there is no reason not to be optimistic for the sport going forward,’ he said. The Cambridge crew kept going to the end but they were outclassed, eventually losing by over six lengths .","Oxford won their 12th women's boat race in 16 years .

And more specifically, a study of 2.3 million has revealed that 7.35am is the most hectic, frenzied time of the morning routine for Australian families. Sophie Falkiner, Australian TV presenter, model and mother of two, can testify to that. 'It’s crazy, in the mornings there is a million and one things to do - uniforms to be found, spelling tests to get done,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Crazy o'clock: A study of 2.3 million parents has pinpointed 7.35am as the most hectic, frenzied time of day in Australian households . Out the door: Getting breakfast, kids dressed and the school run is the cause of much mayhem . Mum of two: Sophie Falkiner has told Daily Mail Australia that she has a 'million and one' things to do in the mornings to get her children out the door . 'The kids get up at 7am so I have to get up at 6.30 to give myself time to have a coffee and get exercise in before starting the day,' the 41-year-old former Great Outdoors and Wheel of Fortune presenter added. According to the study, conducted by Kraft, breakfast is the top priority for parents - with an average of 140 hours spent making breakfast each year (equivalent to 25 minutes a day). 'We're out the door by 8am, so when we all have time to sit together and have breakfast it's the only zen time we have,' said Falkiner. Time it: Australian parents spend an average 140 hours per year getting children breakfast . 'It will only be 15-20 minutes together (and I wish it could be longer!) but these days people are time poor and its hard to get everything done and  be nutritious,' she said. 'My daughter’s not a breakfast person, so getting a quick nut spread and toast in is quick and easy before we head out the door.' The study also found that nut spreads are a popular choice for breakfast loving kids, with Aussie kids eating  spreads 6.7 times a week. Mum knows best:  Sophie Falkner, mum of two, believes nuts are high in protein and good for fussy eaters . Falkiner, who also has a certificate in nutrition says that nuts are a big part of her children's diet and are packed full of nutritional benefits. 'Nuts are packed with good protein. So the spreads are good for fussy eaters, they give your kids important brain food and energy, protein and it helps keep them full until lunch time.' Falkiner's tip is to mix up how you serve nut spreads to make it both fun and varied for kids. 'I will do peanut butter in celery sticks for the kids then on weekend as a treat they will get pancakes and hazelnut spread,' she said. Spread it around: Falkiner says mix up nut spreads during the week adding to celery sticks or pancakes . 'They'd eat the whole container in one go if they could, they ask all weekend and will look forward to having pancakes as special treat.' As for juggling a balance of work, life and kids, Falkiner says the being organised is key. 'I am one of those nerdy list makers and schedulers who uses  a list on the fridge to know where the whole family is each week,' she said. 'We have so much on our plates,  being a mum, taxi, organising play dates, after school parties, groceries, it's tough getting it all done, so being organised is the only way to it.'","New study reveals that Aussie parents spend 140 hours making breakfast .

3184,6c491a9dccd0dc52ee1fdd5ecbf7d73224bdb356,"US authorities have confirmed that the highly toxic pesticide methyl bromide caused a Delaware family to become seriously ill at a U.S. Virgin Islands resort, and that the chemical was used at the resort several times in the past year, officials said Tuesday. The US Environmental Protection Agency said it is contacting people including employees at Sirenusa resort in St. John to determine how many others might have been exposed to the pesticide. It was banned for indoor residential use in 1984. 'Methyl bromide is a potent neurotoxin, so it really affects your central nervous system,' EPA Regional Administrator Judith Enck said in a telephone interview. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay at the Sirenusa Condominium Resort on the island of St. John . The Esmond family had rented a second-floor condominium at Sirenusa, a resort of 22 villas, late last month. Steve Esmond and his wife, Dr Theresa Devine, and their two teenage sons fell seriously ill during their stay on the  island of St. John. The family were airlifted to separate hospitals in Philadelphia suffering major respiratory trauma. Sean, 16, and Ryan, 14, were  in critical condition. The family attorney James Maron confirmed the two parents are recovering but their two sons are in critical condition. James Maron, the family's lawyer, said the boys were in 'rough shape'. 'The family are all fighters,' he told WPBF News. 'They're fighting for everything right now. I understand it's a long recovery.' The US Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation. Sean, 16, (pictured) and his 14-year-old brother Ryan remain in comas two weeks after being hospitalized . Enck said the pesticide was used March 28 on the condominium's first floor, and agents are trying to determine how much was employed. She said the EPA found that methyl bromide was used at other Sirenusa units in the past year, but declined to say how many, citing the investigation. Sea Glass Vacations LLC, which rents units at Sirenusa, said in a statement it has terminated its contract with Terminix and the townhome under investigation is unoccupied. 'We are sending our thoughts and prayers to the family impacted by this tragic incident,' the company said. 'We remain committed to full cooperation with all local and federal authorities.' Terminix spokesman Pete Tosches said in a statement that the company is conducting its own investigation and is cooperating with authorities. 'We're committed to performing all work we undertake in a way that is safe for our employees, customers and the public,' he said. The family was staying at the $875-a-night  Sirenusa Condominium Resort on St. John in the US Virgin Islands . Enck said the EPA is awaiting results of air and wipe samples taken from the condominium. Maron said Esmond, who is an administrator of the private Tatnall School in Wilmington, is conscious but unable to move. Devine, a dentist, was treated and released from the hospital and is currently in occupational therapy. The Tatnall school, where Sean was a star lacrosse player, posted on their Facebook page that they had the Middle School students write get wall cards for Esmond and his family. 'The entire Tatnall community continues to direct its supportive energy toward the Esmonds and asks that everyone keep the family in their thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.' On Friday  the US Environmental Protection agency said preliminary tests showed there was 'a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying' Tuition at the Tatnall school can range from $20,000 to $25,000 a year.

During her marriage to muralist Diego Rivera, Frida penned the letters to Jose, a Catalan artist whom she met while she was recovering from surgery in New York. Their steamy correspondence began shortly after she returned to Mexico following the trip and continued throughout their secret three-year romance. 'I don’t know how to write love letters. But I wanted to tell you that my whole being opened for you,' then-39-year-old Frida wrote in October of 1946. Scroll down for video . Secret romance: Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (pictured) wrote passionate love letters to Jose Bartoli from 1946 and 1949 while she was married to muralist Diego Rivera . Enduring love: A collection of 25 of the unpublished letters will be auctioned off at Doyle New York on April 15 . She continued: 'Since I fell in love with you everything is transformed and is full of beauty… love is like an aroma, like a current, like rain.' The letters, 25 of which are headed to auction at Doyle New York on April 15, were written in Spanish between August 1946 and November 1949 and saved by Jose until his death in 1995. The archive of passionate messages, which comprise more than 100 pages, were passed down through different generations his family until they reached the current owner. According to Frida Kahlo biographer Hayden Herrera, the artist told Jose to sign his letters as 'Sonja' so that Diego would think they were from a woman if he came across them. High price: The letters (pictured) are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 dollars . Pet names: Frida signed her letters to Jose 'Mara', which biographer Hayden Herrera explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her . Creative couple: Jose, a Catalan artist, can be seen sitting at an easel as he works on a painting . Handle with care: This letter from the archive shows a stain on the right hand corner of the paper . Famous works: In this letter, Frida refers to 'Tree of Hope', a painting she created shortly after she met Jose . Diego, a muralist and a notorious Lothario, who once had an affair with Frida's younger sister Cristina, endured Frida's love affairs with women, but her relationships with other men would drive him to bouts of crazed jealousy. Meanwhile, Frida inscribed her letters with the name 'Mara', which Hayden explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her. The collection also includes an original drawing of a sleeping cat, pressed flowers, ribbon, beads and drafts of a few of Jose's responses. Frida's candid messages to her lover shed light on her important paintings, an unknown pregnancy and her relationship with Diego, as well as her adoration for her Jose. Full package: The letters also include an original drawing of a sleeping cat and drafts of a few of Jose's responses . Sketch artist: Frida sent Jose this drawing of a tree in reference to 'The Tree of Life' City living: Frida posed for this photo in front of a skyline. She and Jose met when she was recovering from surgery in a hospital in New York . Long distance love: Frida ended this letter to Jose with a kiss, leaving behind a lipstick print of her mouth . Their secret affair began when Frida, who was left a partial cripple after a 1925 bus accident, was recovering from a spinal fusion performed in June, 1946 at New York’s Hospital for Special Surgery. Frida's sister Cristina was the one to introduce her to Jose, who moved to New York after fighting in the Spanish Civil War. They fell in love during his visits to the hospital and continued their long-distance courtship after she returned to Mexico. After Frida sold her 1946 painting Tree of Hope, which was inspired by her recent surgery, she wrote to Jose about his words influenced her creation. 'I remembered your last words and I began to paint,' she explained. 'I worked all morning and when I finished eating I kept on painting until there was no more light. But afterward I felt so tired and everything hurt.' An artist's life: Frida was photographed holding this statue while she stood in front of a blue cement wall . Inspired work: Frida sketched this drawing of a sleeping cat and sent it to Jose . Added images: This letter featured a picture of a women sleeping in a bed while another walked away . Last words: Frida ends this letter by telling Jose that she loves him . Epic romance: In this letter Frida told Jose she loves him the way that he is . In the painting one version of Frida lies in a hospital bed, while another depiction of herself sits proudly while holding a flag. While painting the piece, Frida inscribed 'Tree of Hope Keep Firm' a line of a song that she and Jose both liked. According to Hayden, Frida wrote in several of her letters to Jose that she had missed her period, in a way that suggested she was in some ways hoping to have his baby despite knowing it was nearly impossible because of her spinal injury. 'If I were not in the condition I am in now and if it were a reality, nothing in my life would give me more joy. Can you imagine a little Bartoli or a Mara?' she wrote. New images: Frida posed in her house for this photo take by French photographer Gisèle Freund . Full of life: Frida can be seen standing in her garden in Mexico in this image shot by Gisèle .

The Anfield boss was ordered to pay £400 and £375 costs, with a £40 surcharge at Blackburn magistrates' court for leaving a £69,950 terrace house in Accrington with broken windows and doors and rubbish strewn across the garden. Rodgers - whose Liverpool side crashed out of the FA Cup on Sunday in a 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa - and his business partner Judith O'Hagan were found guilty of ignoring an improvement notice issued by Hyndburn Council. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has been convicted of leaving a property in Accrington to rot . Rodgers had been told to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish from the house's garden . The pair had been ordered to fix the windows, doors and roof, and to remove the rubbish, but the house was left to rot. Both Rodgers and O'Hagan, who bought the property in August 2007, were absent when found guilty at Blackburn magistrates' court. Local neighbours and former tenants of the property have criticised the failure to maintain the property. The house is located in an area of Accrington which is undergoing a £13million regeneration project to sort out over 200 derelict empty properties. Former Deputy leader of Hyndburn Council, Clare Pritchard, said at an earlier stage of the project: 'We are working with PlaceFirst on a major regeneration project to bring over 200 derelict empty properties back in to use in Woodnook within the next three years. 'As an authority we take a tough line on people who fail to bring their properties into repair and this strong enforcement policy will play a part of the regeneration of the area.' The house (outlined) is in an area which is undergoing a £13million regeneration project, this image was taken in March 2009, seemingly before the issues which brought on the magistrates court case . The Liverpool boss issues instructions to Emre Can  during Sunday's FA Cup defeat by Aston Villa at Wembley . An improvement notice, as served to Rodgers and O'Hagan, requires a landlord to carry out work to deal with a hazard associated with a property. If the landlord does not do the work, or 'reasonable progress' is not made, the local authority can carry out work itself and claim the costs back from the landlord. They were convicted in December 2013 of failing to comply with an enforcement notice under Section 79 of the Building Act 1984.

The incredibly detailed works of art were inspired by Faberge's famous jewelled eggs, and painstakingly created by 14 of the UK's top cake artists. Each of the intricate treats is entirely edible and were made using a range of decorating techniques and sugar work. Scroll down for video .

Purple cake with gold detailing and purple roses by Rose Marie's cake (left) and Zee Chik Cakes' peephole egg with sugar work figurine (right) The eggs were created as part of a feature for Cake Masters Magazine - and feature in this month's edition, with Easter just around the corner. Rosie Mazumder, editor of Cake Masters Magazine, said: 'The eggs that have been created for this feature are just fantastic. 'The attention to detail and the hours spent working on the eggs shows in the presentation of each individual one. 'The eggs were on display at Cake International in London last weekend, and it was great to get a closer look at them all.' The creations take their inspiration from the iconic Russian eggs created by jeweller Peter Carl Faberge which were famously gifted to figures including the Tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II. Textured masterpiece: Cakeium's frosted blue base is decorated with gold icing and beading as is the egg itself . A fairy sits on a pedestal in the middle of this cake made by by Suzanne Thorp of The Frostery which also features clover leaves and a hand-painted plaque of Mary Berry .

Jacqui Kelly from Totally Sugar, who created the patriotic Union Jack egg, said: 'I am a Scots girl at heart but London is my adopted home. 'And when I drive along the river in the evenings, the lights of the London skyline take my breath away every time. So it was easy to draw inspiration when I knew the eggs would be displayed at the ExCeL in London.' Laura Loukaides, from Laura Loukaides Cakes, said: 'My egg is inspired by one of my favourite Fabergé designs - the 1914 Mosaic egg created for Nicholas II of Russia. Cupcake Oven's pink, green and gold cake was made using a special cake enamelling technique,  royal icing piping, and golden sugar roses . Totally Sugar's cake features the Union Jack and London landmarks including the Millennium Dome, London Eye and Tower Bridge . Bella Baking's egg cake is covered in sugarpaste and all the decoration is piped in royal icing . 'The craftsmanship and detail is just incredible. I wanted to combine the jewelled effect with my favourite colour scheme - black, gold and pearl. 'I love how black diamonds look in fine jewellery so I wanted to replicate the style by creating a diamond encrusted egg using individually placed sugar pearls.' Suzanne Thorp, from The Frostery, said: 'Faberge created these lavish eggs for Russian royalty - so I thought about our ""Queen of Cakes"", Mary Berry. 'My egg is in appreciation of her. The inspiration came from the 1902 Clover Leaf egg and it includes clover leaves, a hand-painted plaque and a sugar fairy as the surprise.' Yellow Bee Cake Company's Vicky Turner said:  'As soon as I saw the Fabergé carousel eggs, I knew that would be my inspiration for my own egg. 'I wanted to give the egg a cake theme so, instead of horses, I've used cakes. You'll even spot my first ever hidden scene cake in there, amongst slices of cakes and a tiny model of a crab on a cupcake.' Ceri Badham and Linda Donnelly make up the mother and daughter team of Fancy Cakes by Linda. Fancy Cakes by Linda's (left) pink egg cake features spring flowers made from sugar paste and was made by a mother-daughter team.  A 1920s flapper girl perches on top of Pimp My Cake's pastel blue creation which was inspired by Lily of the Valley style eggs  (right) Mrs Donnelly said:'Our design is inspired by the beautiful pink and gold Fabergé eggs. The colours work beautifully together. 'Fabergé eggs have a very ornate presence and we wanted to keep this in our design, but also add our own style. 'We created oval plaques with rich gold moulded edging, in keeping with Fabergé, and inside, we placed hand-crafted sugar flowers inspired by the four seasons of weather in the UK.' Calli Hopper of Callicious Cakes was inspired by art. She said: 'I was inspired by a Baroque/Rococo theme for my Faberge egg. I came across a series of delightful late 18th century illustrations by German artist Felix Schlesinger, who did a series of rustic paintings. 'As we are nearing Easter, I thought this an endearing theme to reproduce and hand paint.' Diana Woolmer of Dee's Sweet surprise said: 'My favourite Fabergé eggs are the ones decorated in pearls with lots of gold detail. This is my style of cake decorating so, for me, this is what I had to go with in terms of design. I kept my colours simple and let the gold do its thing.' Calli Hopper, who runs Callicious Cakes, was inspired by 18th century illustrations by German artist Felix Schlesinger . 'The hardest part of the process for me was the design part, my head was full with too many ideas,' she continued. 'In the end I ditched the sketch pad, covered my egg in icing and just went to work with what felt right. Each pearl was added individually and I even made some of my own silicone moulds for some of the details. The egg took me around five days to finish.' Rhu Strand of Pimp My Cake said: 'My inspiration came from the Lily of the Valley style eggs. 'My passion in sugar is creating figurines; I was drawn to the Lily egg and instantly wanted to include a 1920s flapper girl. I have used wire work to create the stems and sugar pearls for the flowers.' Inga Ruby-Burn of Bella Baking said: 'My egg is inspired by the series of exquisite Imperial Faberge eggs, which were made for the Russian Imperial family between 1885 and 1916. During that time period, ornate royal iced cakes were affordable only to the very wealthy and so it seemed only appropriate to pipe all the decoration on to my egg. The main covering represents a speckled duck egg.' The Cake Masters Magazine Sugar Eggs Collection went on display at the ExCel in London from March 27 to 29 with more than 1.2 million visitors flocking to see the elegant edible treats.

He knows the family well and is expecting it to be a tough day for everyone. ‘The funeral will take place next Wednesday, but everything else has yet to be confirmed.

8198,0a73d38138ef4176245aa928ada60ff0e2c1bb4d,"Gary Neville believes Louis van Gaal's greatest achievement as a football manager is the making of Jose Mourinho. Van Gaal and Mourinho come face-to-face on Saturday when the former's Manchester United travel to Premier League leaders Chelsea. The duo have been friends since they first worked together at Barcelona in 1997 where they enjoyed a successful relationship at the Camp Nou. Louis van Gaal's (right) greatest achievement in football is the making of Jose Mourinho, feels Gary Neville . Mourinho (left) and Van Gaal will come face to face again when Chelsea host Manchester United on Saturday . Mourinho (left) worked under Van Gaal as his assistant manager at Barcelona for three years in 1997 . With Mourinho as the Dutchman's assistant, they won the La Liga title twice in their first two years together in Catalonia. It was Van Gaal who entrusted and encouraged the Portuguese to go into management - with the 52-year-old having won titles in Portugal, England, Italy and Spain since as well as the Champions League twice. And in his column for the Telegraph, Neville says Van Gaal will be proud of his friend's achievements. 'A former Tory leader once said when asked what their greatest achievement was: ""New Labour,"" the former United and England defender wrote. 'I can imagine Louis van Gaal, when answering the same question from a group of journalists, peering back from his desk and responding: ""Mourinho"".' Ahead of Saturday's clash at Stamford Bridge United have been dealt a quadruple injury blow with the news that Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo will all be unavailable. Van Gaal though will be able to call on the services of the in-form Marouane Fellaini. The Belgian midfielder has scored twice in United's last four league games - including a header in their 4-2 derby win over rivals Manchester City on April 12. Marcos Rojo (right) is one of four United players who will miss their league trip to Chelsea due to injury . The Red Devils have in-form midfielder Maraoune Fellaini (left) available for the trip to Stamford Bridge . Fellaini (right) scored United's second goal in their 4-2 win over Manchester City on April 12 . And Neville believes Mourinho may try to nulify the threat of the big Belgian midfielder by selecting John Obi Mikel or Kurt Zouma in midfield. Neville added: 'As for Mourinho, will he blink and deploy John Obi Mikel or Kurt Zouma in midfield alongside Nemanja Matic to deal with Marouane Fellaini in that dangerous United left channel? 'If he does, how will his team get hold of the ball without the rhythm of Cesc Fabregas in that deeper role and feed an attack already hit by the loss of Diego Costa? I could see United having 60 to 65% of the ball if Mourinho does opt for this solution. 'As a tactic, this wouldn't ordinarily worry the Chelsea manager, but the idea of Van Gaal going to Stamford Bridge and not only winning, but also dominating the ball, would maybe open up the wounds of his early encounters with Barcelona while coaching Real Madrid, when the Barca purists outplayed and beat his team well. I’m also pretty sure it would not be something that Roman Abramovich would enjoy. 'My hope is that they go for each other in a manner which suggests that both feel that they are superior in the football department.' John Obi Mikel (centre right) could start in midfield for Chelsea in a tactic to nullify the threat of Fellaini .","Chelsea entertain Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday .

Aeman Presley, 34, faces charges for the killing of two homeless men in Atlanta, another man sleeping outdoors in DeKalb County and a hairdresser in a parking garage in Decatur. Presley is set to appear in front of a DeKalb County judge today and district attorneys in both DeKalb County and Fulton County have said they will seek the death penalty. Bloodlust: Aeman Presley (center), 34, who allegedly killed four people had originally set out to rob his victims but was overcome with 'bloodlust' after killing the first man . An investigator for the Fulton County district attorney's office detailed Presley's slide and eventual turn to violence in court documents. The man had taken a Greyhound bus from Los Angeles to Atlanta last May 'hoping to rejuvenate his beleaguered acting career,' according to a sworn statement by the investigator. At first, Presley settled into a homeless shelter in Atlanta and worked small food service jobs, but when his money ran low, he bought a Taurus .45 revolver 'on the street' to use in robberies, the statement said. On September 26, Presley took a bus to DeKalb County with the intent of finding people to rob, according to documents filed in court. He came upon 53-year-old Calvin Gholston sleeping beneath a shopping center breezeway, firing three shots that killed him, the statement said. That incident produced 'a self-described adrenaline fueled high,' according to the statement. 'This high manifested into a ""bloodlust"" which compelled Presley to commit two more murders in Fulton County.' Targeted: After Presley killed Calvin Gholston (left), 53, he felt a 'self-described adrenaline fueled high' and went on to shoot Dorian Jenkins (right), 42, while he slept on the sidewalk in November . Tragic: 68-year-old Tommy Mims (left) was shot while sleeping under a railway bridge while 44-year-old Karen Pearce (right) was killed in a parking garage on her way home from dinner . Having apparently abandoned plans for robbing strangers, Presley found Dorian Jenkins, 42, sleeping on a sidewalk under several blankets and killed him on November 23, the statement said. Wanted: After killing Pearce, Presley said he decided he did not want to continue killing and tried to go back to a career in acting, before getting arrested for jumping a turnstile . A few days later, he killed 68-year-old Tommy Mims as he slept under a railway bridge, later coming across two other homeless men he considered killing before deciding it would be too risky, according to the statement. 'Since he was ""getting off on killing people,"" he wanted to kill them, too,' the statement said. 'He decided, however, that doing so would increase his chances of apprehension.' He instead turned around and went back to where he shot Mims, believing he had not killed him, and shot him twice more in the head, according to the statement. Presley was in Decatur on December 6 and found 44-year-old Karen Pearce walking alone on her way back from dinner with friends. He ordered her to hand over her wallet at gunpoint, which she did, though Presley still shot her once in the chest, killing her, according to the statement. After Pearce died, Presley said he didn't have the same feeling of adrenaline, and later told investigators he had never wanted to kill a woman. He then tried to return to acting, and was on his way to get headshots taken on December 11 when he was arrested for going through a train station turnstile without paying. During an hours-long interview by Atlanta police detective David Quinn, Presley said he didn't think he was 'a biologically malevolent person.' Some events of his life, including his father's early death and mother's illness contributed to a 'murderous spirit,' along with, Presley said, membership in Chicago's Gangster Disciples and rap lyrics.","Aeman Presley, 34, faces charges stemming from a string of murders that officials say he committed last year .
His alleged victims were Calvin Gholston, 53; Dorian Jenkins, 42; Tommy Mims, 68; and Karen Pearce, 44 .

3698,4a7e57cce1d381dc9ad7d2c6744863ced4cfcc0b,"Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton issued a pointed defense of her family foundation on Thursday after allegations surfaced that it reaped millions from foreign countries that had issues pending before her mother when she was secretary of state. 'What the Clinton Foundation has said is that we will be even more transparent' in the wake of the scandalous claims, said Chelsea, the philanthropy's vice chair, 'even though Transparency International and others have said we're among the most transparent of foundations.' Clinton, the daughter of former U.S. president Bill Clinton and presumptive Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, spoke during an event on women and girls at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York City. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Chelsea Clinton defended her family philanthropy on Thursday in New York, calling it 'among the most transparent of foundations' The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation is under fire for allegedly accepting millions from foreign entities in exchange for special favors from the State Department when Hillary Clinton was at its helm . Hillary Clinton (seen Wednesday at Georgetown University) was helping approve Russia's purchase of US uranium production as her foundation received millions from executives tied to the deal . ABC News hosted the event, and reported that Chelsea outlined what she said is 'the right policy. That we'll be even more transparent. That to eliminate any questions while we're in this time, we won't take new government funding, but that the work will continue as it is.' The foundation recently committed to stop taking donations from foreign governments but insisted it wouldn't return money it has already collected. That hasn't sat well with Republicans vying for their party's presidential nomination: Hillary Clinton is Public Enemy Number One on the campaign trail, and they smell blood. 'Having raised tens of millions of dollars from foreign nations presents a clear conflict of interest for anyone running for President of the United States,' Texas Sen. Ted Cruz wrote Wednesday on Facebook . Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who hasn't formally entered the 2016 hunt, told Daily Mail Online that 'not only should they definitely give back the money and cease accepting foreign donations, but should also make every effort to find missing documents that would shed light if in fact they are innocent.' More problems: The Clinton Foundation erroneously reported it had received no funds from governments for three years – even though it previously received millions – and now has to refile its tax returns . Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly FIorina called the series of accusations against Bill and Hillary 'the Clinton way: raking in millions from foreign governments behind closed doors while making promises about transparency that they never intended to keep.' The Republican National Committee pounced as well. 'The new revelations reported by the New York Times continue to raise serious questions about Hillary Clinton's judgment and her handling of conflicts of interest surrounding the Clinton Foundation while serving as Secretary of State,' RNC spokeswoman Allison Moore said in a statement. Thursday's unrelenting news cycle about possible overlaps between the former first family's personal and charitable finances were prompted by details emerging about a new book titled 'Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.' The book, due in stores next month, reportedly includes evidence that Hillary Clinton doled out special State Department favors to governments – and for-profit companies tied to them – in exchange for foundation donations and six-figure speaking fes for Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon laid out a lengthy defense on Thursday, writing online that a New York Times article outlining the charges included no 'direct evidence in support of the claim' that Mrs. Clinton did anything wrong. Former president Bill Clinton (left) received $500,000 for a Moscow speaking engagement with Renaissance Capital. He also met Vladimir Putin (right), at the time Russia's prime minister, during the visit . This week in New Hampshire, Hillary herself brushed off the brewing scandal. 'We're back into the political scene, and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and I'm ready for it,' she told reporters in the town of Keene. 'I know that comes unfortunately with the territory.' 'It is, I think, worth noting that the Republicans seem to be talking only about me,' she added. 'They wouldn't have anything to talk about if I weren't in the race. But I am in the race, and hopefully we'll get onto the issues, and I look forward to that.' Mrs. Clinton herself has yet to outline any serious public policy positions in connection with her run for the White House.","Former first daughter is now vice chair of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation .

Residents who have been hit by wild weather across New South Wales are being warned to brace for more floods and damage with another storm predicted to hit this week . People struggle against the heavy rain and strong wind on the streets in the Sydney CBD last week . 'Any weather that strikes up north is of concern to us, especially considering the devastation from the storm that hit last week,' Ms Wills told Daily Mail Australia. 'Any water is going to hit that saturated ground and raise flood levels again, and any wind is going to knock over the trees that are uprooted.' Ms Wills said the SES was particularly worried about the effect more wild weather would have on the Hunter region, which suffered through flooding and high winds in the last storm. 'That's our focus - the Hunter region - because they've been smashed,' she said. 'We really are quite concerned about that particular area. 'We are urging the community to prepare themselves, prepare their homes and prepare their families to prevent further loss and devastation.'

3047,befc1a51717caded1f778ea37d64b2cfa923b15f,"He is regarded as the next big thing in South American football and he's coming to the Premier League. Chelsea are set to confirm the £4.5m signing of Nathan Allan de Souza on Wednesday, beating rivals Manchester City to his signature. The dazzling Brazilian attacking midfielder, who turned 19 last month, arrives from Atletico Paranaense with a glowing and ever-growing reputation. Scroll down to watch video of Chelsea's new signing Nathan in action . Chelsea are set to announce the £4.5million signing of Brazilian wonderkid Nathan . Nathan tweeted the news he was set to sign for Chelsea by revealing he was headed for contract talks and a medical. He said: 'Very happy!!! In London to sign my contract with Chelsea and take tests' Full name: Nathan Allan de Souza . Born: 13 March 1996 in Blumenau, Brazil . Position: Attacking midfield . Clubs: . Atletico Paranaense (2014-15) - 13 appearances, 0 goals . Chelsea (2015-) - signed April 2015 . International: . Brazil U17 - 6 caps, 5 goals . Brazil U20 - 5 caps, 0 goals . Nathan will add to the Samba feel at Stamford Bridge, joining compatriots Willian, Ramires, Filipe Luis and Oscar. And he should have plenty to offer Jose Mourinho's side on the evidence of his highlights reel for his club and the Brazilian youth teams. The YouTube compilations certainly offer enough to get Chelsea fans excited - there are lightning-fast runs through opposition defences, pinged long balls to the forward line and a promising knack of getting into goalscoring positions. Most of the best bits come from the 2013 FIFA Under 17 World Cup, the tournament that first alerted the Premier League elite to Nathan's talents. Although Brazil only reached the quarter-finals of the competition, Nathan scored five goals and demonstrated his full potential. He found the net twice in a 6-1 rout of Slovakia and scored two more as the hosts UAE were beaten by the same scoreline. Nathan is brought down by Martin Junas of Slovakia to win a penalty during the Under 17 World Cup in 2013 . The young midfielder made his name while starring for Brazil at the tournament two years ago  in Abu Dhabi . Nathan shows his strength by shrugging off the challenge of Russia's Dimitriy Barinov . In the last eight, he scored an 85th-minute equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Mexico, before converting in the marathon penalty shootout, which Brazil ultimately lost 10-11. His classy performances earned him a spot in the FIFA Team of the Tournament and a star was born. At that time, Nathan was playing for the Atletico Paranaense Under 19 side. The club is based in Curitiba, a city about three hours' drive from his hometown of Blumenau. But those performances out in the Middle East put the rocket boosters on his career, with promotion into the first-team squad at his club and advancement to the Brazil Under 20 team, for whom he has played five times. Chelsea will soon boast another Brazilian in their ranks to add to the likes of Willian (left) and Oscar (right) Nathan will join Ramires (right, in action against QPR last Sunday) as the fifth Brazilian in the squad . Nathan will not be ready to throw into the Chelsea first-team right away. He hasn't yet completed a full 90 minutes for Paranaense, with the majority of his 11 appearances in the Campeonato Brasileiro Serie A coming from the bench. Leaving Brazil will come as something of a relief for Nathan and, in particular, his family following an ugly contract dispute with the Brazilian club. With his contract due to expire this month, the club informed Nathan's father and agent, Jose Carlos de Souza, they wished to trigger a clause to keep him for another two years. Nathan currently plays in midfield for Atletico Paranaense in the Brazilian league . Nathan battles for the ball against Tiago Real of Goias at Arena da Baixada stadium in November last year . Caught off guard, Nathan's family offered the club £2m to release him from the contract and allow them to negotiate with European clubs who had shown an interest. Paranaense refused, saying that figure fell well short of what they could sell the player for and went to court to settle the dispute. But with a fee now agreed with Chelsea, the club should drop the legal proceedings when he settles in at Stamford Bridge. It now remains to be seen whether Nathan can live up to his promise in the Premier League.","Chelsea are set to sign Nathan from Atletico Paranaense for £4.5m .

Challenged about claims senior Tories are 'posh boys', Ms Harman, Labour's deputy leader, insisted they were only 'standing up for people at the top'. But sharing a breakfast TV sofa with her was Mr Osborne, who said that as they both went to St Paul's School in London, 'the posh boy attack always sounds a bit thin'. Scroll down for video . Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman and Tory Chancellor George Osborne, who both went to the same school, shared a sofa on the TV this morning . In the 1980s, Mr Osborne attended St Paul's School for boys, where a place for a pupil boarding costs now £10,800-a-year. Ms Harman went to St Paul's Girls School in the 1960s . In the 1980s, Mr Osborne attended St Paul's School for boys, where a place for a pupil boarding costs £10,800-a-year. Ms Harman, who went to St Paul's Girls School in the 1960s, has repeatedly accused the Tories of being 'completely out of touch'. She has previously faced the wrath of Labour backbenchers when she sent her son and daughter to selective grammar schools. Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Ms Harman complained about Tory attacks on Ed Miliband that he 'stabbed his brother in the back' for the Labour leadership. Host Andrew Marr asked: 'Is that somehow worse than accusing George Osborne and David Cameron of being 'posh boys'? Is there any difference really?' Challenged about claims senior Tories are 'posh boys', Ms Harman, Labour's deputy leader, insisted they were only 'standing up for people at the top'. Ms Harman did not resile from the class-based attacks, and added: 'Well I think we're saying they're standing up for people at the top and everybody else has been suffering and the recovery hasn't reached people. 'But that is quite different from saying that as Prime Minister Ed Miliband would stab this country in the back.' But sitting barely three feet away on the couch, Mr Osborne shot back: 'Well Harriet and I went to the same school, so the posh boy attack always sounds a bit thin when coming from her. 'But the point I'd make is we've got a really positive vision for this country and actually I've found this campaign enormously energising and exciting. 'And I go round the country - people are switched on, people do care about this country's future.' Ms Harman attacked the Tories over their commitment to spend an extra £8billion on the NHS, insisting it was 'absolutely illusory' Earlier Ms Harman said Conservative plans for 'extreme' spending cuts would inevitably mean further cutbacks to health. 'The reality is that the spending programme that they have put forward is a threat to cut the NHS. It is absolutely illusory. 'I don't think that people will believe it anyway. People know that they find it harder to see their GP since the Tories came into government, they know that they wait longer in accident and emergency and that waiting lists are starting to grow.' Mr Osborne insisted, however, that the Conservatives had shown in government that they were able to make the savings necessary to deliver additional funding for the NHS. 'We have a balanced plan to grow our economy, to make savings in government including in welfare to fund our NHS each and every year,' he said. 'We have to make similar savings each year that we have made for five years of this parliament but for two years. 'We have a track record in this parliament where we found almost £8 billion extra in real terms for the National Health Service in very, very difficult economic circumstances so we have proved our mettle, we have proved our ability to stand behind the National Health Service in this parliament. We can do it in the next.'","Tory Chancellor mocks Labour's deputy leader as they share TV sofa .

And concerns are so great that one security source has warned: ‘However much physical security you have, if someone is already in there, there’s nothing you can do to stop them committing an act of sabotage or terrorism.’ MI5 is now giving advice on the risk posed by thousands of employees working in sensitive areas – known as ‘insiders’ – highlighted by the Germanwings disaster. Warning: MI5 has issued an alert over the threat posed by rogue workers in Britain’s nuclear, transport and public services after co-pilot Andreas Lubitz killed 150 people in the Alps plane crash disaster . Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was being treated for depression, was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground. Guidance issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), a security agency accountable to the director general of MI5, recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees, with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public. But a BA pilot, who has been with the company for several years and flies regularly around the world, claimed the airline did not carry out mental health checks. The pilot, who did not wish to be named, said: ‘British Airways is more interested in checking whether I have a hernia than mental health. ‘There is no testing regarding mental health.’ A BA spokeswoman refused to discuss details of health checks carried out on pilots. The CPNI has identified a number of motives for employees becoming an insider threat, including theft, revenge, a hunger for notoriety, political or religious ideology and fear or coercion, where external pressure is exerted on a worker. Rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 . A CPNI study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation, but whose loyalties changed after recruitment. Disturbingly, it also found that in many circumstances the workers had been in their organisation for some years before going rogue. Some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information – such as in the case of US whistleblower Edward Snowden – process corruption (where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends) and corporate espionage. The security source said: ‘Years ago, the emphasis was on external security. Now ‘‘the insider’’ is the growing threat, as seen in the cases of Edward Snowden and Lubitz. ‘We advise companies to look closely at their personnel. The higher security clearance they gain over their time of employment, the closer they should be monitored.’","Alert issued over rogue workers in nuclear, transport and public services .

The 18-year-old Hampton Park man had his Preventative Detention Order - which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days -  removed, and the teenager was re-arrested. The man has now been charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts', according to Victorian Police and AFP. Scroll down for video . A third man has been charged after raids in Melbourne led police to foil an Anzac Day terror plot. Police uncovered swords and knifes after searching five teenager's homes . He will appear in Melbourne Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. On Monday a police insider revealed sickening details about the alleged Anzac Day terror plot, claiming the accused men planned to run over a police officer and then kill him with a knife. According to the ABC, a security official close to the ongoing investigation said the group of five men intended to take the officer's gun and embark on a shooting rampage on the streets of Melbourne. The shocking plans mirror those of Islamic preachers Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, who ran down 25-year-old soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich south-east London in May 2013 before 'butchering him' to death. Sevdet Besim (pictured) along with four other men, planned to run down a police officer before using a knife to stab him to death . The British-born Muslim converts ran Rigby down in a car before hacking him to death with a meat cleaver and knives in a frenzied attack.. They dumped the body of the father-of-one in the middle of the road near Woolwich Barracks in south east London. Adebolajo and Adebowale lay in wait near the barracks and picked Fusilier Rigby to kill after assuming he was a soldier because he was wearing a Help for Heroes hooded top and carrying a camouflage rucksack. Sevdet Besim, from Hallam in Melbourne's south-east, was charged with 'conspiracy to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts' at the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Saturday afternoon . Both men were shot by police in dramatic scenes captured by CCTV. They claimed they were 'soldiers of Allah' and were motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing. The five men who were arrested in anti-terror raids on Saturday in Melbourne, after the culmination of a month-long operation code-named Operation Rising, were planning a strikingly similar attack. Around 200 police officers were involved in the raids and investigations are still ongoing. Police said the alleged plot could have been executed any time in the next week after they found knifes and swords in the teenager's homes and it emerged that they were scouting police stations in the run-up to their attack.

The 14-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire allegedly communicated with Australian men who were planning to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Greater Manchester Police said today the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' Mr Besim did not apply for bail and was remanded in custody for a filing hearing on April 24 . The teen was interviewed by police all morning before travelling to the Magistrates Court where he was charged . Two of the five men arrested in pre-dawn raids on Saturday remain in custody, including Sevdet Besim, 18, of Hallam, who was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act. A second 18-year-old man, of Hampton Park in Melbourne's southeast, is being held under a Preventative Detention Order, which allows police to hold a person without charge for up to 14 days. He has now been charged. The duo were 'associates' of Abdul Numan Haider (pictured). His parents have spoken out after it emerged the five men were trying to avenge their son . Police held one of the alleged ringleaders in jail under tough new terror laws, despite not being charged. The man, who cannot be identified due to suppression orders, could be held for the whole 14 days after police applied for a Preventive Detention Order. Both men often frequented the controversial Al-Furqan Islamic study centre in South Springvale. A friend of the two men still in custody said they became radicalised after the death of Numan Haider. Haider was killed by police last year after he attacked officers with a knife, and is believed to have planned an ISIS-like attack. The two alleged ringleaders of the Anzac Day plot reportedly attended Haider's funeral. Haider's parents spoke out for the first time since his death in September, when he was gunned down while trying to stab two officers. Their comments come after it emerged the five men who planned Saturday's attacks were planning to avenge their son. 'We just want only peace for our family — and Australia,' Haider's father told the Herald Sun. 'We don't want violence.' It was also revealed the young men arrested on Saturday had personal links with a senior Australian jihadist and Islamic State recruiter in Syria. All five men are from suburbs in the city's far southeast. Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash (left), 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS . Pictured is one of the homes in the suburb where police made one of several arrest during terror raids . Police are exploring the role played in the plot by Neil Prakash, 23, who is considered to be the top Australian recruiter for ISIS, according to Fairfax Media. Prakash, who is know by the jihadist name Abu Khalid al-Kambodi, may have been in direct communication with the teenagers until recently. Islamic preacher Junaid Thorne, a self-styled Australian jihadist speaker, has described the raids in Melbourne as the 'usual nonsense' and said it was 'strange' how authorities could stop alleged terrorism plots 'but can't foil rape incidents'. Mr Thorne has been a regular speaker at the controversial Al-Furqan Centre in Springvale in Melbourne, where the five men arrested at the weekend also attended. Like the five men arrested at the weekend, Mr Thorne was linked with 18-year-old Numan Haider, who was shot dead in September after stabbing two police officers at a Melbourne police station car park. Just two days before 18-year-old Sevdet was arrested at his Melbourne home on Saturday, he was perusing the Facebook page of Junaid Thorne. Residents living next door to the homes that were raided in the early hours of the morning have described waking to glass smashing, screams and 'fire-cracker like' noises before seeing lights . Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) and Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan (left) address a media conference in Sydney. Mr Abbott urged all Australians to continue with their Anzac Day celebration plans as normal . 'Strange how Australian authorities always foil terrorism plans, but can't foil rape incidents, robberies, domestic violence or anything else,' Mr Thorne tweeted in the wake of the arrests. 'May Allah be with the young kids and their families who were arrested today in #MelbourneArrest over mere speculation and the usual nonsense.' Thorne had also befriended Sharky Jama, the former Melbourne model who was killed earlier this month while fighting with Islamic State. The 25-year-old has also posted messages online in support of the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris. Thorne sparked outrage in January when he told social media followers that insults to the Prophet Mohammad were 'not allowed' and were likely to 'simulate some kind of response' following the terror attacks in Paris. Thorne, who moved to Saudi Arabia with his family where he lived for 14 years until he was deported in 2013 for protesting his brother's imprisonment on terror charges, was in February banned from applying for passports or travelling overseas. The self-proclaimed sheik attempted to gain passage on a flight under false identification. Over the past 12 months, Thorne's views have been the subject of public scrutiny. Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne has come out in support of the five teenagers . Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them (on) certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.' Following the nation's biggest ever terror raids last September, he labelled Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in a statement posted on his Facebook page. After Melbourne man Numan Haider, 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers outside of a police station, Thorne said that he had been 'murdered by authorities'. Thorne later told the ABC Haider had attended some of his lectures, which he performs around the country. Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State. He told the ABC last year: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them (Islamic State), I would get in trouble,' he said. 'If I was to say that (I) don't support them at all, that would be untrue. 'I may support them on certain issues, while I disagree with them on other issues'.

9661,159c1d51be4c10bad81c5ebab63c1e97eaebbf90,"More than 70 years ago these five men each played their own vital role in the Normandy campaign that began with the D-Day landings. Two were just teenagers, another was a young sapper, one a rookie tank driver and the last was a veteran of jungle warfare. All ordinary young men doing their bit to help liberate France. Until now their exploits have escaped the attention of historians, but yesterday these veterans of World War Two stood proudly side by side after being awarded France’s highest decoration, the Legion d’Honneur. Courageous veterans are given France's highest honour for their vital role on D-Day in a ceremony at Yorkshire Air Museum, Left to Right: Gordon Collinson, Eric Gerald Briscoe, Thomas William Wright, Eric Gill, James Denwood and Catherine Rush who was accepting the Honour on behalf of her late husband Bernard Rush . Conducting the ceremony at the Yorkshire Air Museum at Elvington, near York, the French Ambassador Sylvie Bermann told the frail veterans: ‘I am here in recognition of your heroic accomplishments in the liberation of France and to honour your bravery and dedication.’ Aged between 90 and 99, they are among the first of 2,800 living veterans who will receive the Legion of Honour in the months to come. The decision was announced by French President Francois Hollande following last summer’s 70th anniversary celebrations and the ambassador said: ‘France will keep its promise.’ Although the memories are now fading, this group of humble soldiers - along with the widow of a veteran who died recently - couldn’t hide their pride as they received what will probably be the last medal of their extraordinary lives. Eric Gill (right), a veteran of the Burma campaign who landed on a beach in Normandy, pictured during the liberation of France . GERRY BRISCOE was a butcher when he joined up at 18, a year later he was putting his life on the line by storming a Normandy beach. It was his first ever action and a terrifying experience for a hardened veteran let alone a youngster. A sapper with the Royal Engineers, he owes his life to a stroke of luck. ‘On D-Day I should have been the last one in the boat to be the first one out because I was carrying a charge to blow up a pill box,’ he recalled. ‘I miscounted so I finished up the first one in the boat and so the last one out. The lad that got out the boat first drowned straight away because the boat went over him. There for the grace of God, I was saved.’. Battle was raging when Mr Briscoe reached shore and discovered the pill box had already been blown up by a shell, but there were chaotic scenes all around. ‘The Germans were still firing at us and there were shells firing all over the place and the rockets from the big main ships were going over to the Germans.’ He said: ‘You are frightened to death really, I remember it well.’ The teenager helped build a bridge in the days that followed and continued working on bridges and roads to help Allied troops as they headed for Germany. He was among the first troops into Brussels and recalled the local citizens coming out with bowls of warm water, because the soldiers were covered in dirt, and meat sandwiches. After the war he returned to working as a butcher. He married wife Jean, now 86, and the couple had two children. Mr Briscoe, 90, from Bradford, said of the honour: ‘I am very pleased about it. I have gone to France regularly over the years and received medals but this one is the top of the shop. France's highest award, the Legion of Honour, is pinned on James Denwood by Her Excellency Madame Sylvie Berman . The Legion of Honour medals for the five veterans aged between 90 and 99 who are among the first of 2,800 living veterans who will receive the Legion of Honour in the months to come . BILL WRIGHT was a fresh-faced 19-year-old recruit and D-Day was his first experience of warfare. ‘People don’t realise that for about half the forces on D-Day it was their first action,’ he said. Mr Wright said he recalled being extremely sea sick on the way over as the seas were choppy. He was on one of the American landing craft and remembered ‘the chap in charge was absolutely brilliant.’ ‘He was not much older than me and looked like a young President Kennedy. He was cool as a cucumber and put us ashore almost dry.’ Mr Wright was in the Staffordshire Yeomanry who came ashore in the ‘second wave’ of troops. Fortunately for him he was inside a tank – working as the radio operator and loader. His tank was stuck in a ‘traffic jam on the beach’ as there were few exits amid the fierce battle. ‘We were too busy to be frightened,’ he said. ‘Everybody was very conscious we were making history. As a young lad out of school it was a most terrific adventure.’ Mr Wright stayed in Normandy for two months before returning to England to re-train to work in amphibious tanks. In the winter of 1944 he saw further action in Holland and then moved into Germany in the final months of the war. ‘My tank was knocked out but fortunately none of us were hurt,’ he said. Her Excellency Madame Sylvi awarded Frances highest honour the Legion dHonneur at the Yorkshire Air Museum . After the war he married his childhood sweetheart Margaret. They had three children and he worked in forestry. Commenting on yesterday’s award, the 90-year-old widower from York said: ‘It’s a great honour, but there are far more deserving souls who didn’t get it.’ ERIC GILL was a veteran of the Burma campaign when he landed on a beach in Normandy. Later, when the action moved to Holland, he had an astonishing escape when shrapnel pierced his helmet and ‘scalped him.’ The Private with the King’s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry suffered a six inch wound on his head and couldn’t see for the blood streaming over his face, but he survived to tell the tale. Born in Doncaster and one of nine children, he left school at 14 to work down the pit. The teenage miner worked with the pit ponies. At 19, with the Nazi threat growing, he joined the army and was in Burma when war broke out. His wartime adventures saw him escape the horrors of the Burmese jungle by walking 400 miles to India, then travel to Australia with 1,000 Italian prisoners of war and on to New York before returning to ‘Blighty.’ He arrived in Normandy four days after D-Day and headed across mainland Europe on the push for victory. Mr Gill, 99, married wife Doris and had two children. He had various jobs, including being a plasterer and graveyard worker, before retiring. Gordon Collinson talks to his Air Cadet grandson Alfie Tomlinson at the award ceremony at the Yorkshire Air Museum . GORDON COLLINSON should have been in the relative safety of a tank when he landed on Gold Beach. Unfortunately, his tank broke down and couldn’t get off the landing craft. The 20-year-old tank driver was forced to wade ashore carrying his rifle around his head as bullets flew all around him. A man of small stature, the water was up to his nose at one point, but he was grabbed by his comrades and managed to survive the terrifying experience. He eventually found a tank to board so he could continue with his duties. Mr Collinson ended up battling his way across France and going into the heart of Germany during the final months of the war. He was among the Allied troops to reach Berlin in May 1945 after the Russians arrived first and witnessed the scenes of terrible devastation. After the war he married and had three children and spent the rest of his working life as a civil servant. He is now aged 91 and living in York. JAMES DENWOOD was lucky to survive the early stages of the war to take part in the Normandy invasion. He was on board the troopship and former Cunard liner the Lancastria when it was sunk in June 1940 as it evacuated exhausted soldiers from northern France. Around 5,000 died but Mr Denwood was among the lucky ones and survived. ‘It went down in 20 minutes,’ he recalled yesterday. ‘I was like a duck and had to swim.’ The veterans of World War Two stood proudly side by side after being awarded France’s highest decoration, the Legion d’Honneur . The Legion of Honour medals were awarded after an announcement by French President Francois Hollande following last summer’s 70th anniversary celebrations and the ambassador said: ‘France will keep its promise' He was a sapper in the Royal Engineers during the D-Day landings and was designated to work on a fuel pipeline - ensuring the Allied forces could maintain total air supremacy. He married wife Edith during the war and the eldest of his three children was born in 1944. When the fighting ended he returned to Cumbria to work in the quarries and eventually moved down to South Yorkshire to work in a steel works. He is now aged 97 and living in Mexborough, South Yorkshire. BERNARD RUSH was a chief petty officer in the navy and turned 21 five days before D-Day. He was an engineer whose job was to repair damaged vehicles. After the war he returned to working in the cotton mills at Silsden, West Yorkshire, and rose to become a manager. Mr Rush died last September aged 91 but the French government took the ‘exceptional’ decision to give the father-of-four the promised award posthumously. His widow Catherine, 83, collected it for him and said: ‘He would have been over the moon and so proud.’","Group are the first living veterans of 2,800 to receive the Legion of Honour .

That's according to a study that found almost 30 million health records nationwide were involved in criminal theft, malicious hacking or other data breaches over four years. The incidents seem to be increasing. Compromised information included patients' names, home addresses, ages, illnesses, test results or Social Security numbers. Most involved electronic data and theft, including stolen laptops and computer thumb drives. The study didn't examine motives behind criminal breaches, or how stolen data might have been used, but cyber-security experts say thieves may try to use patients' personal information to fraudulently obtain medical services. Breach: A recently-published study that found millions of health records in the US were involved in criminal theft, malicious hacking or other data breaches over four years (file photo) Cases that didn't involve malicious intent included private health information being inadvertently mailed to the wrong patient. Hackings doubled during the study, from almost 5 percent of incidents in 2010 to almost 9 percent in 2013. Hackings are particularly dangerous because they can involve a high number of records, said Dr. Vincent Liu, the lead author and a scientist at Kaiser Permanente's research division in Oakland, California. 'Our study demonstrates that data breaches have been and will continue to be a persistent threat to patients, clinicians, and health care systems,' Liu said. The study appears in Tuesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. A JAMA editorial says there's evidence that the incidents are leading some patients to avoid giving doctors sensitive information about their health, including substance abuse, mental health problems, and HIV status. 'Loss of trust in an electronic health information system could seriously undermine efforts to improve health and health care in the United States,' the editorial said. Author: Dr. Vincent Liu,  a scientist at Kaiser Permanente's research division, was the lead author on the study . Patients should be alert to cyber threats, including 'phishing' emails from hackers posing as doctors, hospitals or health insurance companies, said Lisa Gallagher, a cybersecurity expert at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society. Those messages require clicking on a link to get information, and patients should instead should call the purported sender to verify whether the email is legitimate, she said . Patients should also double check doctor bills and other insurance company information. 'Don't throw away your explanation of benefits. Take a look at them,' Gallagher said. 'If you see care that wasn't provided to you, or dates and names of providers that don't make sense, go to the provider and report that.' For the study, Liu and colleagues analyzed an online database regulated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and containing mandated reports of breaches in health information protected by federal privacy law. Over the four years, 949 data breaches were reported across the country.  The numbers climbed annually, from 214 in 2010 to 265 in 2013.  Nearly 60 percent involved theft. Prominent cyberattacks affecting two health insurance giants happened after the study. Last May, a data breach hit Premera Blue Cross, affecting about 11 million customers and others. And between last December and late January, hackers accessed an Anthem Inc. database with information on nearly 80 million people. Authorities believe hackers in China may be behind both attacks, Gallagher said. She said cybersecurity is among key topics at her nonprofit group's annual meeting this week in Chicago. Members include doctors, hospitals, health plans and sellers of electronic health record products.

They have a TV channel devoted to it, and one show – a sort of Bulgaria’s Got Talent for folk acts – features people of all ages swaying in stately unison. Indeed, they are so proud of the music that when asked to include something in the capsule aboard the Voyager 2 space probe, they sent tracks from the album Le Mystere des Voix Bulgares, in the hope that aliens would like it too. Colourful outfits! Villagers dressed in the traditional Bulgarian costume . I love this kind of folklore as long as it really is part of the local culture and not just put on for tourists. In Bulgaria it is genuine: practically every village in the mountains has at least one choir, and their own particular variation of traditional dress, and many hold festivals in the way that English villages stage fetes. When I decided to go to Bulgaria I looked for a holiday combining exploring the remote southern mountains with a festival. Despite much trawling on the internet, I couldn’t find a package on the right dates, so instead I combined a group walking tour with an independent excursion of my own. I began by joining a group of 11 other walkers, led by a guide who, it turned out, danced as naturally as she walked. We stayed in a village called Yagodina high in the remote Rodopi mountains. Golden wonder! The autumnal colours shine on the Rodopi mountains in Bulgaria . Apart from the hotel, Yagodina was totally devoid of any tourist infrastructure. The hole in the wall was not a cash machine but a spring. For the people living there, the end of communism did not appear to have resulted in a dramatic increase in consumer choice – the only two shops sold the barest of necessities. Each morning we set off through pine forests and scrambled above the tree line to meadows so full of wild flowers that I counted 22 varieties in one square metre as I was having my picnic. We walked up to nine miles every day. The level of difficulty was described as ‘moderate’ but I found it quite challenging. Unlike most of the other members of the group, I didn’t have walking poles, so I picked up two sticks and tapped along until I got into a rhythm. Yagodina Cave in Rhodope Mountains in part of the Trigrad Gorge and was the result of an earthquake that made the huge cave in the marble bed of a river . On the way down, we walked past fields of potatoes – the staple diet in the mountains – and through Muslim villages, a legacy of the Ottoman empire. It was easy to see why folklore survived in these places as they are so cut off from the outside world. At the end of one walk we scrambled down to the Yagodina cave system, its luminescent stalactites and stalagmites dripping eerily as they have done for millions of years. Evidence of prehistoric man was displayed almost casually, including a mug with a handle that looks as if it could be used to served tea today. Picturesque scenery! Old stone bridge and mountain stream near the cave of Yagodina . On my last evening, a group of villagers came to the hotel to entertain us. Rashly, some of us agreed to put on traditional costumes too and dance rather inelegantly with them. When I came to leave the group the next morning, I had to sign a release form saying I was responsible for my own actions, which made my trip to the festival seem more adventurous than it really was. I splashed out on a cheap taxi for the trip across the mountains to the ski resort of Bankso (the one place I don’t want to go back to). Next morning, things became more difficult as the locals use the Cyrillic alphabet which I found impenetrable, so I couldn’t read the destination on the bus timetable. Trees covered in a fresh snowfall on Todorin Vrah, in the Pirin Mountains . Fortunately, a woman, who told me in broken English that her daughter was picking tomatoes in Chichester, spooned me on to a crowded minibus to the Pirin mountains. Through the trees came the sound of singing and the banging of drums. Each village had a stage of its own where its people performed their songs and were awarded certificates for participating. Traditionally, women aren’t allowed to play instruments so they sang while the men played flutes, fiddles and drums. Traditional Bulgarian national costume worn by villagers in the Pirin mountains . It was a joyous occasion, put on for their own pleasure, not for tourists. Once the certificates had been awarded, everyone joined in, regardless of whether they were wearing traditional costume or jeans. I resisted invitations to dance and just sat and watched. A young teacher said she ‘revered’ their customs. ‘I hope you are getting a good impression of Bulgaria,’ she said. I certainly was.

3025,1203b98b4a1739d0f88789ea59f4cceffde40f2d,"Moscow (CNN)Joy Womack is taking part in her first ballet class of the day at the Kremlin Ballet Theatre, kicking her legs up to her head, jumping and spinning across the room. After class, she eats boiled sweets, one after another -- they are a cheap form of energy. The dancer, raised in California and Texas, left her parents and eight brothers and sisters behind when she arrived in Russia six years ago, aged 15, speaking no Russian. She studied at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy and was one of the first Americans accepted from the school into the company. But in 2013 she left under a cloud -- media reports suggested she had claimed she was asked by an unnamed Boshoi official to pay $10,000 to dance in even small roles. The Bolshoi still stands by comments made at the time by its general director, Vladimir Urin. He asked the dancer to make an official complaint and defend her position legally, saying the theatre was ready to assist the law enforcement agencies to investigate the case and that ""if the facts are legally established, those responsible should be punished accordingly."" The dancer did not pursue a case against the Bolshoi. When she left the Bolshoi in 2013, Womack joined the Kremlin Ballet Theatre where she still works, aged 20, as a principal ballerina; dancing close to the Russian president's office, next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the Kremlin. The surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not: for her role as a principal dancer Womack says she is paid around $240 a month -- which works out at around $8 a day. The dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the Russian ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered, in part, from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on Russia over its annexation of Crimea last year. Womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food. ""For anyone paid a salary in rubles, especially since the crisis, it is extremely difficult. You have to decide what is worth more for you - experience or financial stability. I'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more."" Sitting in the wings of the stage, chatting in Russian to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for Swan Lake, she says she has to make the $185 in her bank account last for the next few weeks. To earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad. The Kremlin Ballet Theatre says Womack's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that, ""on average, the salary [principal] dancers are paid is significantly higher"" than $240 a month but that Womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars ""depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month."" As an American, Womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the Russians. But she says that is not always the case offstage. ""It's extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the United States and Russia. The great thing about working for a Russian company is that we are focused on creating art but...outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners; the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover."" Although relations between the U.S. and Russia have taken a nosedive since Russia's annexation of Crimea last March, Womack says she is ""very loyal"" to the Kremlin Ballet Theatre. ""I love the Russian system and I'm very patriotic in that sense,"" she says. And despite the political situation -- and the money -- she says, ""Russia has a lot to offer, it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one's career in.","20-year-old American dancer makes $240 a month at Kremlin Ballet Theatre .

Cleveland's power forward was injured in the first quarter of the Cavaliers' 101-93 victory that completed a four-game sweep when he and Boston's Kelly Olynyk chased a loose ball into the left corner after Jae Crowder of the Celtics missed a 3-pointer. Olynyk's right arm became entangled with Love's left arm. Love then grabbed his arm and kept running toward the Cleveland bench before going to the locker room, where he iced his shoulder. Olynyk was charged with a non-shooting foul. Scroll down for video . Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love injured his left shoulder during the first half in game four of the first round of the NBA Playoffs against the Boston Celtics on Sunday . Photos appeared to show that Love was dragged by the arm by Boston Celtics center Kelly Olynyk during the first quarter resulting in an injury that forced the Cavaliers forward from the game . 'I thought it was a bush-league play,' Love said after the game while wearing a sling. 'I have no doubt in my mind that he did it on purpose,' Love said. 'Olynyk was in a compromising position, had no chance to get the ball, and it was just too bad that he would go to those lengths to take somebody out of a game.' Boston coach Brad Stevens didn't think Olynyk hurt Love on purpose. 'That's not the type of person he is,' Stevens said. 'I hope Kevin's OK to play, whenever they play next, because you want everybody out there to finish the game.' Love said he intends on returning to the playoffs this season and wants the NBA to review the play. 'Oh, the league will take a look at it,' he said, 'and it better be swift and just.' 'I thought it was a bush-league play':  Love, left, has been openly critical of opponent Olynyk following the incident . The Cavaliers said Love would return to Cleveland with the team and receive additional examination, imaging and evaluation at Cleveland Clinic Sports Health over the next 24 hours before his status is updated. Love averaged 18.3 points in the first three games and scored the first basket Sunday. The Cavaliers would be off until at least Saturday before opening the Eastern Conference semifinals against either Chicago or Milwaukee. The Bulls lead that series 3-1.

So visitors to Dornoch’s golf course or the Sutherland town’s historic cathedral were surprised instead to be pointed in the direction of some toilets, the local GP... and an abattoir. And even if bewildered tourists did suddenly fancy a trip to the slaughterhouse, they would discover it is in the process of being demolished. On a visit to the Scottish town of Dornoch, tourists are pointed towards the local slaughterhouse . Visitors to Dornoch, pictured, have to move quickly if they wish to visit the abattoir - as its being demolished . The bizarre sign caused an online stir after it was posted on Twitter and retweeted by Scots crime writer Ian Rankin. The photo was originally put online by Jon Palmer from The Cheese House, Cromarty, who tweeted: ‘Market day tomorrow in the town that has all bases covered when it comes to tourist attractions.’ The tweet then quickly drew a series of facetious online comments. Stephen Foster asked: ‘Sweeney Todd lives anywhere nearby?’ Malcolm Ramsay said: ‘A trip to Dornoch? It’s kill or cure...’ Gavin Sutherland of Gavin’s Traditional Butchers, based in the nearby retail park in Dornoch, said yesterday of the abattoir: ‘It has been knocked to the ground. They are demolishing it as we speak. It’s been derelict for four or five years.’ Brown signs normally only point to attractions or sites of historic significance. A Highland Council spokesman said: ‘We are looking into the current status and accuracy of the sign in question.’","Dornoch in Scotland is pointing tourists towards the local abattoir .

7845,cbbfa370f624ec2333bd9bc4c5d1e01a9fa2dbac,"Northampton's maligned hit man is primed to go big-game hunting again  with no intention of toning down his use of legitimate force in the wake of renewed criticism. Courtney Lawes arrived in France with the Saints, ahead of the Champions Cup quarter-final against mighty Clermont Auvergne, carrying notoriety as excess baggage. His brutal tackle on France fly-half Jules Plisson at Twickenham last month, in the Six Nations finale, angered the visitors to the extent that they tried to have him banned. While the match officials and citing officer deemed that no action was needed, the England lock has been derided as a thug across the Channel and there were cries of protest in these parts, too. England lock Courtney Lawes made a trademark hit on France fly-half Jules Plisson . Click here to read Jeff's article on Lawes' tackle . Writing in these pages, Jeff Powell suggested that Lawes should apologise for an offence that he argued would put parents off allowing their children to play such a brutal, damaging game. The comments found their target but the 26-year-old is a laid-back character and was unfazed by the storm he had created. ‘I just took it on the chin and thought, “People are going to say what they think sometimes, and sometimes people are going to view things differently”,’ said Lawes as he prepared for another momentous Anglo-French encounter. ‘Obviously he has the outlet of the Daily Mail to post his thoughts. I tweeted him. I wasn’t fussed about it but I thought I’d send him a little tweet, just to get my own back a bit!’ Aside from that particular outburst of condemnation, there were widespread concerns expressed about the timing and legality of his tackling style, but Lawes is unperturbed and emphasised his largely clean disciplinary record. ‘To be honest, as long as it is legal and I’m not putting my team in any jeopardy doing it, in terms of me getting booked or sent off or anything like that, I’m going to do anything I can to help the team,’ he said. ‘I’m not the sort of person who is fussed about what people think of me. I’m only bothered about what I can do for my team and for myself as a player. Coaches know how good you are, no matter what things other people are saying outside the room. Lawes crumples Plisson in the aftermath of his monstrous tackle on the French fly half . ‘The fact is that my record is very clean. I’ve only been cited once and I’ve never been red-carded. I don’t think I’ve had many yellows, if any, this year. I don’t have a malicious streak. I know I’m not a thug, I don’t go around punching or fighting, any of that rubbish. ‘I just get on with the game. I don’t even allow people to get me too aggravated, I just get on with my own thing. I’m comfortable being who I am. If people want to say I’m something else, that’s fair enough.’ One of the accusations levelled at Lawes is that he sets out to intimidate smaller opponents, notably half-backs, leading to a multitude of one-sided collisions. He argues that trying to unsettle and nullify these primary decision- makers is a reasonable and vital aspect of his repertoire. ‘If you can put pressure on the 10, then you go out and put pressure on the 10, and if you can do it legally then why can’t you do it?’ he said. ‘That’s the way I see it. I’ve got that kind of timing around the ruck and I’ve got the speed to get to the 10. My size is the reason that the impact is so big, but I don’t go looking for it. A livid Yoann Maestri pushed Lawes in the face and grapples with the England man following his challenge . Lawes and Maestri continue their disagreement on their feet as matters threaten to boil over . ‘It makes a big difference to the game if you can stop the 10 from passing or stop that particular play. It doesn’t even have to be a big hit, it just makes a difference if that 10 knows that he has pressure on him. ‘There is obviously a line between a legitimate and a late tackle because people get yellow-carded for late tackles. ‘You watch the replay of the hit on Plisson and the other player has not caught the ball before we’ve hit the ground. The fact is, had the tackle not looked as severe as it did no-one would have said anything. ‘The only reason is because of the impact, which looks bad because he’s landed on his head. I haven’t tipped him up or anything like that — I’ve just followed through with my tackle. I didn’t even know he didn’t have the ball until I looked up afterwards.’ 26-year-old Lawes passes the ball during a Northampton Saints training session earlier this week . Lawes has revealed that he intends to maintain his destructive style of play for Northampton on Saturday . Asked if he intended to resume normal, destructive service for Northampton on Saturday — in defiance of the criticism — he added: ‘Yeah, of course. I’ve never done anything to get myself sent off in terms of my tackle timing or whatever, so why would I stop if it is legal?’ Northampton, the champions of England, face a colossal challenge against a French club who simply do not lose at home, especially in Europe. The Saints and three of their fellow Aviva Premiership teams have daunting ties away from home, but captain Dylan Hartley has hope for the quartet. ‘I am fully confident in ourselves,’ Hartley said. ‘I think Wasps have a big ask in Toulon but we saw with 14 men the other night how dangerous they can be. I think Sarries against Racing could get a result there. And Bath v Leinster, who knows? I think there could be a few upsets.’","Courtney Lawes has been derided as a thug across the Channel .

It's the latest in a series of such incidents that have forced the carrier to divert or recall flights. Television images showed firefighters approaching the plane at the airport and putting out the fire, and the Airbus A320 aircraft's passengers were evacuated safely. The Turkish Airlines plane lands a second time with the right engine on fire after earlier aborting a first attempt . One passenger took a photo of the severely damaged wing from their seat, and right, as the plane circled above Istanbul Ataturk Airport flames could be seen coming from the engine . Turkish Airlines spokesperson Dr. Ali Genc told MailOnline Travel: 'Turkish Airlines TK 1878 Milan-Istanbul flight has landed safely after its first attempt to Istanbul Ataturk Airport. The plane slid off the runway after its landing by its declaration of emergency landing. 'The evacuation has been safely and promptly completed. Our 97 passengers on board have been safely taken to terminal. Currently, there is no injuries or no health problem on any of our passengers reported. 'The necessary investigation has been started to clarify the causes of the incident.' Airlive.net are reporting that while attempting the first landing, the right side landing gear collapsed forcing the pilot to abort. It is believed the right landing gear was damaged on a first landing, that led to the right-hand side fire . The plane was quickly evacuated on landing, and there are no reported injuries from the 97 on board . Passengers were safely led from the stricken plane that ended up on the grass after the emergency landing . The moment of impact once the plane landed at Ataturk Airport saw more flames from the aircraft . People took to social networks to praise the captain's safe landing of the Turkish Airlines flight . As the plane circled in the sky, flames could clearly be seen from the damaged area. The photos began to be circulated on social networks, and people expressed their relief at news the passengers escaped the plane unhurt. On Twitter Flyingpilot79 wrote that he was glad the flight had landed, and 'that everyone is ok', while Nicholas Guerts added: 'Well done to the #TK1878 crew for getting that aircraft on to the ground safely!'

10341,e559a6b1f44d11afe2de7a3fe217d0f5b36eb970,"The future of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent sparked a bitter war of words yesterday. Tories claimed Russian leader Vladimir Putin would be happy with Ed Miliband as prime minister because he cannot be trusted to keep our Trident submarines. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon led a ferocious assault on the Labour leader – claiming he is a 'backstabber' who cannot be trusted not to sell out in a 'grubby' deal with the SNP. Scroll down for video . Tories also pointed to a survey suggesting up to three-quarters of Labour election candidates oppose the replacement of Trident. Business and skills minister Nick Boles, a close ally of David Cameron, went further, claiming the Russian president would be pleased to see Mr Miliband enter Downing Street propped up by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. 'Ask yourself this. Who does Vladimir Putin want to see running Britain after May 7?' Mr Boles demanded. 'Answer: the man who abandoned the Syrians to their fate and the woman who wants to scrap our nuclear deterrent. He… stood alongside Putin in protecting [Syrian President] Assad.' Mr Miliband reacted with fury to the attacks, accusing the Tories of 'desperate smears' and dragging the election campaign 'into the gutter' by claiming he would 'stab the UK in the back' in the same way that he did brother David in the Labour leadership contest. 'David Cameron should be ashamed,' Mr Miliband said, insisting that Labour was committed to renewing the Trident fleet. But Mr Fallon's promise to renew all four submarines appeared to leave Labour in disarray. Mr Fallon said the full replacement of Trident would be a 'red line' in any second Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. 'I want to see multilateral disarmament, I'm not in favour of unilateral disarmament. That means we have got to have the least cost deterrent that we can have.' - Ed Miliband, January 5 . 'We're going to see whether there's any way you could do it with three [submarines].' - Ed Balls, March 15 . '[Four submarines] is exactly the policy that we have had for a very long time.' - Chris Leslie, Wednesday . 'Four boats... but we'll look at that in government.' - Douglas Alexander, yesterday . 'It's right to have a review because technology changes.' - Ed Miliband, yesterday . For Labour, however, frontbenchers gave differing positions. Some suggested a Labour government might cut the number of submarines. Mr Miliband said he favoured 'basically four boats' but it was 'right to have a review' while Labour treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said that maintaining four submarines was 'exactly the policy that we have had for a very long time'. Earlier this year Mr Miliband had said he favoured the 'least cost deterrent' possible. And in March, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had said the party would see whether three submarines could suffice. Military experts insist four submarines are the minimum needed to ensure Trident can be deployed at sea at all times. Any fewer would mean that the missiles would on occasion be left vulnerable in port. Mr Fallon attacked the idea of having only three, saying there was no point in having a deterrent that 'takes the weekend off'. A survey of Labour candidates, conducted by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, suggests that Mr Miliband would have difficulty carrying large sections of his party with him if he sought to renew Trident. In several Labour safe seats, MPs who supported Trident are being replaced by candidates who oppose it. They include Meg Munn in Sheffield Heeley, whose replacement Louise Haigh says: 'Investment in nuclear is immoral in and of itself'. Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said the lack of clarity from Labour over Trident left Britain in a 'very dangerous position'. 'Unless we are absolutely sure where they would be then we have to assume that they are not fit to protect this country by having a continuous nuclear deterrent,' he said 'In a very dangerous world that is a very dangerous position.' As many as three-quarters of Labour candidates oppose the replacement of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent. Pictured is the HMS Victorious off the coast of Scotland . CND's survey of Labour candidates suggested as many as three-quarters opposed the replacement of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent. The anti-nuclear group said last month it had polled a 'representative sample' of Labour candidates, including sitting MPs. But Labour critics claimed only 73 candidates had been surveyed with 50 or so anti-Trident. The finding suggested anti-nuclear Labour MPs could make common cause with the Scottish National Party, which has said it wants to ditch Trident. Labour's official policy is to maintain a continuous, submarine-based deterrent. But many senior figures want Labour to back a more limited, cut-price deterrent – while others believe the party should scrap it altogether. Kate Hudson, CND's general-secretary, said: 'Labour candidates are in step with public opinion. The majority of the public don't want tosee £100 billion spent on nuclear weapons.' Mr Cameron backed Mr Fallon's attack and challenged Mr Miliband to rule out any arrangement with the SNP that would put Labour into power. He said: 'When I listen to what Labour are saying, they are playing fast and loose with the country's security.' Miss Sturgeon said: 'We would never be in any deal with a Labour government who is going to renew Trident.'","Tories say Russia's Vladimir Putin would be happy with Ed Miliband as PM .

5821,bebd06c7c9c4fdc89581ccad26a91162c962bf8e,"A high-flying Tory MP has been ordered to remove ‘interfering’ tweets that risk derailing a murder trial amid claims he was exploiting the case to ‘win votes’. Richard Graham, who is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester, faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down the Twitter posts. At an extraordinary pre-trial hearing, the Old Etonian former diplomat was accused of posting the tweets to ‘ingratiate himself’ with voters by ‘whipping up local feeling’ about the forthcoming case concerning the killing of a teenager. Richard Graham, who is fighting to retain the marginal seat of Gloucester, faces contempt of court proceedings if he fails to obey an order by the High Court to take down Twitter posts a court case . Zac Evans, 19, was killed in a machete attack outside a pub in Gloucester in January while apparently trying to protect a group of girls. The trial, due to take place in June, was originally set for Bristol Crown Court, 30 miles from Gloucester. But after Mr Graham called for it to be moved during an exchange in the House of Commons and wrote to the Lord Chief Justice, it was transferred to Gloucester Crown Court. It was later switched back to in Bristol following objections that Gloucester would struggle to stage such an emotive case. Zac’s family said they preferred the case to be heard in Bristol. The High Court heard concerns by defence lawyers that Mr Graham may have used his political influence to try to get the trial switched from Bristol. They also argued that a number of his Twitter posts could prejudice the trial if not removed from his Twitter account. Zac Evans, 19, was killed in a machete attack outside a pub in Gloucester in January while apparently trying to protect a group of girls . Barrister Stephen Kamlish QC, acting for the defendant in the murder trial, said in court that Mr Graham’s tweets were a ‘clear attempt to win votes by ingratiating himself with his electors’, the MP was ‘potentially out of control on the issue’ and if he refused to remove his tweets or added to them, the defendant may not get a fair trial. Mr Justice Hamblen ordered Mr Graham to remove the tweets ‘as soon as reasonably practicable’, and to say nothing more that could prejudice the trial. Mr Graham insisted he was right to speak out about the trial arrangements, but refused to discuss his tweets, which he said had been removed. On the suggestion that he had used the trial for electioneering, he said: ‘That’s rubbish. 'For an MP not to say anything about an event which filled the cathedral [for Zac’s funeral]... no MP is going to sit there and say nothing.’ A spokesman for the judiciary said: ‘The presiding judge for the area, in consultation with the resident judge, felt it was appropriate to try this case in Gloucester. 'Both have made it clear the letter from Mr Graham did not influence their decision.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Case about Zac Evans, killed in machete attack outside pub in Gloucester .

8275,d83b82a9cd504218e604616be3f3c3928e3428b8,"Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal's recent dealings in the transfer window and has urged his former side to purchase four top players in the summer. The Frenchman believes Arsenal need a goalkeeper, centre back, defensive midfielder and striker if they are to have any chance of winning the Barclays Premier League title. Henry, who was speaking after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea, also hit out at Olivier Giroud by claiming the Gunners will struggle to win the league if his fellow countryman is to remain as the club's first choice striker. Sky Sports pundit Thierry Henry questioned whether Arsenal can win the title with Olivier Giroud in attack . Henry (centre) said after Arsenal's goalless draw with Chelsea that Giroud (right) may need replacing . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 . Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Henry said: 'I think they need to buy four players - they need that spine. They need a goalkeeper, they still need a centre back, they still need a holding midfielder and, I'm afraid, they need a top, top quality striker to win this league again. 'You had the best example with Chelsea here today. They were struggling last season to win the league. They went on to buy [Thibaut] Cortouis, [Nemanja] Matic, Cesc [Fabregas] and [Diego] Costa. 'For me, that speaks volumes and you saw it today - a team didn't and a team did, and they are about to win the league again. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . 'He [Arsene Wenger] has to do it. You need to have this competitive thing within the group - to win the league, that has to happen.' And he added on Giroud's inability to lead Arsenal to the title despite scoring 14 league goals so far this season: 'I think Giroud is doing extremely well. But can you win the league with him? I wouldn't think so. 'He does a job, and he does it ever so well, but you can't win the league. 'Arsenal were at the top of the league last season, but everyone was saying they are not going win the league.' Arsenal need to sign players of a similar calibre to Thibaut Courtois, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa, according to Henry .
